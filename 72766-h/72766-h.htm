</div>


<p>The earlier adventures of Bob Somers and his
friends have been described in “The Rambler
Club Afloat,” “The Rambler Club’s Winter
Camp,” “The Rambler Club in the Mountains,”
“The Rambler Club on Circle T
Ranch,” “The Rambler Club Among the Lumberjacks,”
“The Rambler Club’s Gold Mine,”
and “The Rambler Club’s Aeroplane.”</p>

<p>“The Rambler Club’s House-boat” deals
with the adventures on the Hudson of the
Rambler boys and Jack Lyons and his friends.</p>

<p>They have an exciting and enjoyable time
on the historic river, and begin to appreciate
its varied beauty and charm.</p>

<p>When the “Gray Gull,” Jack Lyons,
Master, is close to Yonkers Bob Somers is the
means of aiding a young man in distress.
Formerly he had been the tutor of a boy
residing at Nyack; but, for a reason which reflects
no discredit upon him, he lost his position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>A friendship springs up all around. The
lads on the house-boat meet the Nyack boy,
who is enthusiastic over the idea of such a
trip, and decides to join.</p>

<p>Misunderstandings arise, and for a while the
trip of the “Gray Gull” promises to be the
means of causing much trouble. But events
so shape themselves that in the end right prevails,
and his chance meeting with the boys
turns out to be a fortunate thing for the former
tutor.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE “GRAY GULL”</p>


<p>“Well, Bob Somers, I certainly am glad
you came on to New York with your father.
Dad has been talking so much about you
Rambler chaps lately that I’ve been simply
wild to meet the crowd.”</p>

<p>“And three of us are here for your inspection,
Jack Lyons,” laughed Bob. “Dave
Brandon”—his hand fell on the shoulder of
a stout, good-humored-looking boy standing
by his side—“is our poet, artist and historian;
and this is Tommy, or, perhaps, I’d better say,
Mr. Thomas Clifton.”</p>

<p>A very tall, thin boy flushed as Jack Lyons
eyed him quizzically and then heartily shook
his extended hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“If titles go by the length of people I think
you’d better add Esquire, too,” gurgled Jack.</p>

<p>“For a long time Tommy was the smallest
member of our crowd,” explained Dave Brandon;
“then, suddenly——”</p>

<p>“Nothing could keep him down,” supplemented
Bob, with a smile.</p>

<p>“And I don’t wonder, after the way you
boys have been living out in the open,” said
Jack. “But what’s the use of our standing
here in the hallway when there are comfortable
chairs in my den up-stairs?”</p>

<p>“And I do feel most uncommonly tired,”
confessed Dave, stifling a yawn, “for, honestly,
I didn’t sleep a minute more than twelve
hours last night.”</p>

<p>Jack laughed heartily as he led the way
into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Mr. John Lyons, his father, a widely-known
New York lawyer and promoter, resided in a
fine mansion on Fifty-seventh Street. Externally,
there was nothing about the house
to distinguish it in any way from the rest of a
long brown-stone row, but the interior was
famed for the wealth and beauty of its appointments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>“Thought you might like to take a look in
here, fellows,” remarked Jack. “Dad goes in
a lot for painting and statuary. Some of these
things he picked up while abroad. Everything
free for this day only. Step around and
see the animals.”</p>

<p>“It’s simply stunning!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>The furnishings were nearly all of the
Louis XV period. A beam of sunlight coming
in through a half-opened window caressed
in its course original chairs and a couch which
had once adorned an old French chateau.
Rare tapestries hung on the walls, while
carved chests and objects of copper and brass
revealed their presence by rich, glowing
touches of color.</p>

<p>Many pictures by old and modern masters
immediately attracted Dave Brandon’s attention.</p>

<p>“Aren’t they wonderful?” he sighed.</p>

<p>“You’ve painted some pictures just as wonderful,”
said Tommy.</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble,” laughed Dave, “wonderful—but
in a different way. Your father
and Mr. Somers seemed to find a lot to talk
about, Jack.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>A hum of steady conversation was coming
from an adjoining room which Mr. Lyons
used as a study.</p>

<p>“That reminds me,” said Jack; “you
chaps will have to unbosom yourselves at
once. Gold mines, aeroplanes and all sorts of
hunting experiences seem to have been in
your line. Come right up to my den.”</p>

<p>The room on the top floor which Jack called
his very own was about twelve by sixteen
feet, and furnished with several chairs, a desk
and table. Gridiron heroes and baseball idols
looked at the beholder from their cardboard
prisons—Jack had them tacked up all over
the walls, while a fishing pole and old-fashioned
musket decorated one corner.</p>

<p>The den did not appear extraordinarily
neat; several coats, a pile of books, and a box
of note-paper with its contents scattered in
glorious confusion over the desk might have
offended a fastidious taste. But Jack airily
explained that a very important matter had
prevented him from tidying up.</p>

<p>“And I’ll tell you all about it, fellows,” he
said, animatedly, when his visitors had seated
themselves. “We—and by that I mean Joe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
Preston, Aleck Hunt, Fred Winter and myself—have
the dandiest scheme. What is it?—Well,
I want to hear your story first. Dad
has been telling me how you found the ‘Rambler
Club’s Gold Mine’—he’s a stockholder in
the company, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and just as soon as father said he intended
to go East to see Mr. Lyons on business
we made up our minds to keep him company,”
said Bob, with a smile.</p>

<p>“It means a whole lot of work for me,”
sighed Dave.</p>

<p>“It’s this way,” a peculiarly gruff voice
broke in—Tommy was speaking—“Dave
always writes a history of our trips. He has
about two thousand, one hundred and ninety-seven
pages finished up to date. So, of course,
this New York trip——”</p>

<p>“Say, fellows!” Jack Lyons jumped up
and began pacing the floor. An idea which
made his eyes sparkle brightly had suddenly
entered his head. “Say, why don’t you
chaps stay here a couple of weeks?”</p>

<p>“Eh?” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“And then your historian would have something
worth while to scribble about.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“How?” asked Dave.</p>

<p>“Well, honest, I can’t keep still about it a
minute longer.” Jack Lyons’ voice indicated
a spirit fairly bubbling over with enthusiasm.
“Why, we’ve got hold of a house-boat—a
real h-o-u-s-e-b-o-a-t, mind you;
and——”</p>

<p>“Intend to take a trip somewhere?” asked
Tommy, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Do we?—Well, I should rather say so!
It’s all arranged, too. Rah—rah! The ‘Gray
Gull,’ Jack Lyons, master, is bound from New
York to Albany. Now”—Jack paused; his
arm swept around in a half-circle—“you
chaps ought to, and, by ginger, must go
along.”</p>

<p>“I felt it coming,” sighed Dave. “That
means another book to write.”</p>

<p>“How about it?” queried Jack, eagerly.
“Don’t say no. It’ll be one of the greatest
trips you ever had. Joe, Aleck and Fred are
dandy chaps. Say, can’t you go out with me
this morning to see our house-boat?”</p>

<p>“Well, r-a-t-h-e-r,” cried Tommy—“eh,
Bob?”</p>

<p>Bob nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>“Sure thing. It will give us a good chance
to see a bit of New York. Where is the
‘Gray Gull,’ Jack?”</p>

<p>“Moored on the Harlem River. Hurray!
I’ll call up Joe Preston just as soon as you’ve
told me a bit about yourselves. Now, somebody,
please fire away.”</p>

<p>The “somebody” happened to be Bob
Somers, and, as he related modestly the story
of their many adventures, Jack Lyons’ eyes
opened wider with interest and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Great Scott; what corking times! Don’t
I wish I’d been along. I must tell Joe you’re
here.” And Jack sprang to the side of his
desk, where the boys noticed a telephone.</p>

<p>“Talk about that for a great scheme,” remarked
Tom.</p>

<p>“Talk through it for a greater,” returned
Jack. “Hello, hello—yes, that’s the number.
Hello, Joe Preston! Not Joe! Well, won’t
you please tell him that Jack Lyons is at the
’phone?”</p>

<p>“He’s at home, fellows.” Jack looked up;
then turned toward the instrument again.
“Hello, Joe! Say, old boy, the Rambler
chaps are here; honest—no joke about it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
We’re going right out to see the ‘Gray Gull.’
Can you meet us there? Good! Yes; maybe
they’ll take the trip with us. Wouldn’t that
be jolly! You pick up Aleck and Fred.
Race you? Sure! Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Fellows, you’ll meet the whole bunch,”
laughed Jack, as he hung up the receiver.
“Now, I’ll explain how we happened to get
hold of the house-boat. A client of dad’s,
who went out west, turned it over to him in
part payment for his services. If dad didn’t
know what to do with the ‘Gray Gull,’ I did;
and the way Joe, Aleck and Fred jumped at
the chance to go on a cruise would have made
you laugh.”</p>

<p>“How do you make it go?” asked Dave,
languidly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m coming to that. A Mr. Marshall
we know owned a motor boat; and, last
month, this boat motored right into a barge.
That kind of scared Mr. Marshall—he found
he didn’t like the sport so much as he thought
he would; and what do you think?”</p>

<p>“Lots of things,” cried the interested
Tommy; “go ahead.”</p>

<p>“When he heard about our house-boat he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
said we could have the engine for it. Wasn’t
that nice of him?”</p>

<p>The Ramblers agreed that it showed a
thoughtful and proper spirit.</p>

<p>“That’s what I say,” exclaimed Jack, enthusiastically.
“And he’s going to have the
motor sent right over, too.”</p>

<p>“Who will install it in the house-boat?”
queried Bob.</p>

<p>“Jim Benton, a machinist who has done a
lot of work for dad. But come on, fellows;
Joe thinks he can beat us out to the Harlem
River. And say, Bob, when you get a chance,
ask your father about going on that trip with
us.” And Jack, happy and excited, fairly
dashed out of the room.</p>

<p>They were on the street in a few moments.
It was a very hot morning in August, with
hardly a breath of air stirring.</p>

<p>“Fellows, I have a dreadful fear that I’m
going to melt,” sighed Dave Brandon, vigorously
mopping his face.</p>

<p>“Do try to last until you see the house-boat,”
urged Tom, with a broad grin.</p>

<p>Seeking shade wherever it could be found,
the four walked toward the elevated railroad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
station at Eighth Avenue and Fifty-third
Street. The city, full of noise, life and color,
possessed immense attractions for the Ramblers,
and Jack Lyons’ patience was sorely
tried, as they often stopped to look about
them. When, at last, all had safely boarded
a train for One Hundred and Fifty-fifth Street
he breathed a sigh of heartfelt satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Dave, this is quite a change, after the
plains and mountains of Wyoming,” remarked
Bob Somers.</p>

<p>The stout boy, gazing through half-closed
eyes at the rows of buildings and streets flashing
by, nodded.</p>

<p>“Not much here to remind us of Lone Pine
Ranch, Bob,” he said.</p>

<p>Station after station dropped behind them.
At One Hundred and Tenth Street the train
swung around a great curve, with Morningside
Heights, crowned by the impressive,
partly finished cathedral of St. John the Divine,
to their left, while on the right they had
a good view of the upper end of Central Park.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it stunning!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“And to think that we’re actually in New
York,” murmured Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“One Hundred and Twenty-fifth!” called
out the conductor, a few minutes later.</p>

<p>The boys caught a glimpse of a wide, busy
thoroughfare. Then the train sent the rails
spinning swiftly behind it again, and the
terminus of the line was soon reached.</p>

<p>The four, mounting a stairway, found themselves
on a great iron viaduct sloping downward
toward the east.</p>

<p>“What dandy views!” cried Dave Brandon,
whose languid mood seemed to drop suddenly
away. “Magnificent! Eh, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Corking!” Bob’s voice was full of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>To the northwest rose a high bluff with
houses on its summit, while near at hand the
boys could see the famous Polo grounds.
Some distance off, veiled in a scintillating
haze, were other hills, with vague suggestions
of buildings dotted here and there over their
surface. Smoke from passing tugs on the Harlem
River seemed to hover almost motionless
in the air, sometimes pierced by bursts of
steam which shone dazzlingly white in the
sunlight.</p>

<p>But Jack Lyons was in no mood to appreciate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
the beauties of this scene; he wanted not
only to be the first to arrive at their meeting
place, but to show his interested visitors the
“Gray Gull” without delay. So he immediately
began walking along the viaduct at
a rate which made them hustle.</p>

<p>“First time I’ve ever been in a walking
match,” chuckled Tom. “How far is it?”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon be there,” answered Jack,
cheerily. “Joe Preston will never win this
race.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes they reached a bridge and
began crossing the Harlem River.</p>

<p>“There’s the famous High Bridge, fellows,”
exclaimed Jack, pointing to the north. “A
dandy, eh? And the ‘Gray Gull’ is moored
this side.”</p>

<p>“Good!” sighed Dave.</p>

<p>A noisily-puffing tug, towing a flotilla of
empty barges, was approaching, and, as a
hoarse blast came over the silent air and was
answered by the whistle of another boat, the
stout boy gave unmistakable evidence of a
desire to hold up the crowd for the double
purpose of rest and observation.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop, fellows,” pleaded Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>All laughed at Dave’s comical expression of
dismay, and kept on moving.</p>

<p>A wide roadway led down to the river, and
this stretch Jack took at a pace which taxed
even the long-legged Clifton.</p>

<p>At intervals the New York boy cheerily exclaimed:
“Not much further!” or words to
that effect, and just when Dave was beginning
to have a dreadful presentiment that this
meant nearly all the way to the High Bridge
he varied the monotony by announcing:
“Hooray! I knew we’d beat ’em. There’s
the house-boat, now.”</p>

<p>Over the top of an ancient, dilapidated
lumber barge just a short distance away the
boys caught sight of the roof of a curious-looking
craft.</p>

<p>“Rah—rah!” cried Tom, as Jack broke into
a run.</p>

<p>“The ‘Gray Gull,’ fellows.”</p>

<p>These words had the desired effect; even
Dave began to sprint, and presently the crowd,
hot and perspiring, came to a halt upon a
small, wooden wharf.</p>

<p>Quite unnecessarily, Jack pointed toward a
solid, substantial house-boat which lay at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
end. A bit of bunting suspended from a pole
hung limp, making the white letters on a blue
ground quite undecipherable.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a dandy?” demanded Jack,
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“I should say so,” answered Bob.</p>

<p>The house-boat was provided with a deck
that extended about three feet in front of the
cabin. The interior was roomy and comfortable,
and contained bunks, several chairs, a
table, cooking stove, lockers for their supplies,
and various wooden pegs upon which to hang
clothes. A bench ran around two sides.
Four windows admitted light, and, as its
former owner had been a man of rather
fastidious tastes, neat curtains helped to give
the interior a pleasant, homelike appearance.</p>

<p>“Fall on board, and get out of this heat,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>He leaped lightly to the deck, threw open
a door, and the others quickly followed.</p>

<p>“There’s plenty of room, fellows,” said
Jack. “Now, really, aren’t you going with
us?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to the worst way,” cried Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>“So should I,” admitted Bob.</p>

<p>“This cozy interior appeals to me,” said
Dave, slowly. “My compliments to the man
who had sense enough to buy this chair.”
He sighed contentedly. “On a nice moonlight
night——”</p>

<p>“You’d get enough inspirations for two
volumes of poems,” laughed Bob. “The
gurgle and lament of restless waves, and all
that sort of thing—what’s that?”</p>

<p>“It’s Joe Preston!” yelled Jack; “here he
comes, with the others. Oh, Joe—here we are,
old chap. Hello!”</p>

<p>A stamping of feet on the wharf and the
sound of lusty voices which had called forth
this outburst was followed by several yells of
greeting. Then the “Gray Gull” was jarred
from stem to stern by three distinct and separate
shocks.</p>

<p>“A waterquake,” grinned Tommy. “Yes,
they’re here, all right.”</p>

<p>“Beat us, after all, you old scamp.”</p>

<p>A rather short and chunky, dark-haired lad
uttered these words, as he stepped inside, his
movements materially assisted by a vigorous
push from behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>“Joe Preston, fellows,” announced Jack.</p>

<p>Two other lads were now standing inside
the door. The introductions which followed
were of a most informal kind. Aleck Hunt
was a square-shouldered, blue-eyed boy, while
Fred Winter, the tallest of the trio, looked
quite solemn and studious, and his appearance
indicated his general character.</p>

<p>There was a great amount of noise and confusion
in the “Gray Gull’s” cabin until all
had found places.</p>

<p>“Here’s where Somers and Winter meet,”
gurgled Jack.</p>

<p>“Not bad—for you,” laughed Joe. “Say,
Ramblers, Jack’s been talking an awful lot
about you lately. Let’s hear——”</p>

<p>“I knew it,” grinned Bob. “Dave, it’s
your turn now.”</p>

<p>And the stout boy, lolling back in his
chair, obligingly answered a volley of questions.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Joe Preston exclaimed:</p>

<p>“That settles it! You fellows will simply
have to go with us.”</p>

<p>“And I almost believe we shall,” laughed
Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>The cabin shook with applause.</p>

<p>“Where on earth should we have been but
for Mr. Marshall’s engine?” said Aleck.</p>

<p>“On the water,” gurgled Joe.</p>

<p>“It ought to be here to-morrow morning,”
went on Aleck, scorning to notice Joe’s flippancy.
“To-day’s Monday; let’s see—Tuesday,
Wednesday—Thursday we ought to start;
and——”</p>

<p>“Dash madly up the Hudson at about three
miles an hour,” laughed Jack. “Say! Who’s
going to do the cooking?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I heard such a bully story to-day,”
interrupted Aleck Hunt. “It was about—let
me see—oh, yes; I remember——”</p>

<p>“Never mind the story. You can’t get out
of cooking that way.”</p>

<p>“Honest—I don’t believe I could even boil
water,” pleaded Aleck. “We’re all feeling
pretty well just now, and it wouldn’t do to
take any risks, you know. Now Joe——”</p>

<p>“Who said I could cook?” demanded Joe,
arching his eyebrows. “If you had mentioned
Fred——”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ll do it the very first day,” declared
Fred, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>But Jack looked at him with a suspicious
smile, and winked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, my boy,” he said; “we’ll take
turns; but yours won’t come the first day.
How about that story of yours, Aleck?”</p>

<p>“Won’t tell it now,” grumbled Aleck.
“Hello! Who’s that out there?”</p>

<p>Some one had jumped on the deck of the
boat. Next instant, the door swung partly
open and a man peered in. He was a large,
strong-looking man, and, as he pushed the
door open wider, the boys saw that he carried
a basket.</p>

<p>“Mornin’, gents!” he said, in a very hoarse
voice. “I was purty sure I heard some one
in here. Any of you want to buy a purp?
I’ve got the likeliest little fellers you ever
see. Not one of ’em but hain’t got a pedigree.”
And he plunged his hand into the
basket and drew forth a small, wriggling
puppy which voiced a protest to such a proceeding
in a plaintive wail.</p>

<p>“Look at ’em, gents. Seventy-five cents;
an’ take your choice—a bargain.” He
dropped the first specimen back, then took
out another and held it up at arm’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
length. “Ain’t it handsome—now, I asks
you?”</p>

<p>“Never saw such an ugly pup in my life,”
answered Joe Preston.</p>

<p>“It isn’t very much on shape,” laughed
Jack Lyons.</p>

<p>“Shape?” The man’s tone was reproachful.
“Well, maybe it ain’t the purtiest-lookin’
dorg you ever see jist now, but I
miss my guess if that ain’t what it grows up
to be. Not one of ’em but hain’t got a pedigree.
Now, gents, which one is it?”</p>

<p>“Let’s get a mascot for our trip,” remarked
Joe Preston. “It’ll be lots of fun.”</p>

<p>“That it will, gents. Goin’ over to Europe?”
And the big man grinned.</p>

<p>“Maybe—if we can reach Jersey first,” answered
Jack. “Hurry up, fellows; pick out
our mascot. My choice is the largest and
fiercest of the bunch.”</p>

<p>One with a very black spot on its nose
and a very white spot on each foot was finally
chosen and placed on the table.</p>

<p>“You won’t never regret a-takin’ of ’im,
gents,” said the man, as he turned to leave.
“He’s got as good a pedigree as any of ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>“There’s one thing we might have done,
Jack,” said Fred, solemnly, when they were
again alone.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Hired that fellow for a fog-horn.”</p>

<p>“He has the voice for it, all right,” laughed
Jack. “Now what’s to be the name of this
fierce purp?”</p>

<p>“Confuse-us,” suggested Joe.</p>

<p>“Confuse-us?” chorused the others.</p>

<p>“Sure! He was a Chinese philosopher.
Never hear of him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my, oh, my,” snickered Jack; “that’s
a good one. Ha, ha! You mean Confucius.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the difference?” said Joe.
“Confuse-us has about the same number of
letters in it. Quit your laughing, Fred
Winter.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see the connection,” gurgled
Aleck.</p>

<p>“Call him Confuse-us, because he isn’t a
Chinese philosopher, that’s why,” said Joe,
calmly. “And, besides, doesn’t he look confused?”</p>

<p>Jack laughed, and so did the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>“It’s as good a name for him as any other,”
said Fred.</p>

<p>And so the matter was settled.</p>

<p>“Now we have a mascot and an engine,”
said Jack. “Hooray! I can hardly wait for
the chug-chug to begin.”</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">THE ENGINE</p>


<p>Next morning, bright and early, the boys
again met at the house-boat. The weather
still continued hot, with scarcely a breeze to
ripple the surface of the river. The glassy
expanse reflected the clear blue sky above;
occasionally tugs and other passing craft sent
long swells rolling shoreward, to break with a
complaining gurgle against the sides of the
boat. Smoke and steam drifted lazily upward;
and the glare of sunlight made any bit of
shade refreshing.</p>

<p>Jack Lyons and Dave Brandon had each
brought with him a package, Dave’s quite
long and Jack’s square. These excited a great
deal of comment.</p>

<p>But, with a stubbornness that aroused their
companions’ curiosity to the highest pitch,
both refused to divulge the nature of their
contents until the house-boat was entered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
Then, as they stood in the cabin, Joe Preston
spoke up:</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake, fellows, let’s see what
you have.”</p>

<p>Dave smiled in a superior sort of way.</p>

<p>“All right, Joe—here goes; we had this
with us out west.” And, as the others crowded
around, he untied the long package.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz—a telescope!” cried Joe. “I
was always going to get one.”</p>

<p>Joe was noted for his consistent intention
to do something which somebody else always
did first.</p>

<p>“A beauty,” put in Aleck. “Let’s have a
squint through it.”</p>

<p>“And won’t it be dandy to look at the
stars!” chimed in Winter, the studious one.
“Bully for you, Dave. Now, Jack, what’s in
the other?”</p>

<p>“Jiminy, doesn’t the bridge look near?”
cried Aleck, leveling the telescope through
the open door. “Seems as if we were right
on top of it. And that little boat over there
isn’t little—it’s big, and—say—what’s this?”</p>

<p>Jack was holding up a small, framed picture.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that, fellows?” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
asked, proudly. “I made it myself. Didn’t
know I could paint, eh?”</p>

<p>“Best picture of a hat I ever saw,” declared
Joe. “Don’t know just what style it is,
but——”</p>

<p>“A hat?” A rather sad smile curled
Jack’s lips. “A hat?” His voice quite lost
its accustomed cheeriness. “Why, that’s the
house-boat—our house-boat, you blundering
pirate.”</p>

<p>“Why—er—honest—but now I can see it,”
grinned Joe, with a wink at nothing in particular.
“Oh, yes, I was too far away. There’s
the roof——”</p>

<p>“And deck,” chimed in Fred, forgetting
his usual solemnity, and vainly trying to
stifle a gurgle.</p>

<p>“And you can even read the name,”
laughed Aleck. “All done by hand, too.
The water’s great.”</p>

<p>“It ought to be—it’s in water-color, isn’t
it?” inquired Joe. “Hang it up, Jack.
Never thought you could do anything like
that,” and, as Jack looked at him suspiciously,
he hastened to add, “Anything so good, I
mean.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>“And now let’s have the tube that makes
little boats turn into big boats,” said Fred,
when the painting had been placed in a prominent
position.</p>

<p>For an hour the lads amused themselves
with the telescope, and watching the antics of
“Confuse-us,” and then began to grow impatient,
fearing that some delay might prevent
the engine from reaching them that day.</p>

<p>Then a voice outside caused Jack to spring
up.</p>

<p>“It’s Jim Benton,” he said, as a hail reached
their ears.</p>

<p>The machinist, with a bag of tools, clambered
on board.</p>

<p>“Hello, Jack!” he said. “Hello, boys!
Where’s your engine?”</p>

<p>“Over in Jersey, I’ll bet,” answered Jack,
in a disgusted tone. “Sit down, Jim. What
do you think of this—great, eh?”</p>

<p>“It’s swell, that’s what it is,” said Jim,
slowly, as he looked around. “Fine as most
any room in town. Bless me! Wish’t I was
a youngster ag’in. I’d go with you.”</p>

<p>“They said the engine would be here this
morning,” grumbled Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>“Well, the morning ain’t half over yet,”
said Jim, consolingly. “Ain’t this here b’ilin’
weather, though?”</p>

<p>He settled himself comfortably on the bench,
and prepared to take a good, long rest.</p>

<p>The morning passed. Jim ate his lunch,
while the boys wandered off in search of the
nearest store. When they returned, hot and
tired, the wharf wore a deserted look.</p>

<p>Jim and “Confusion,” as Fred Winter had
taken the liberty of calling the pup, were taking
a nap, but both promptly awoke when
Joe Preston hit the door a resounding bang
with his fist.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” mumbled Joe, apologetically.
“Such things will happen on house-boats.”</p>

<p>About three o’clock, when hope had been
given up, a two-horse team rumbled over the
wharf, and Jack gave a loud cheer.</p>

<p>“Hooray, fellows, it’s here,” he announced.</p>

<p>Then a wild scramble to be the first off the
boat followed, greatly to the terror of young
Confuse-us.</p>

<p>“I feel thirsty ’nuff to drink the hull river,”
announced the driver, as he stepped down.
“That’s a purty heavy injine. Wish I had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
piece of gold as big. Where d’ye want it
put?”</p>

<p>“On the boat,” said Winter, solemnly.</p>

<p>“All right! Git up there! Whoa, boy!
Gee-eee. Give me lots of room, you kids.
Gee-ee—whoa! If it bumps like that again,
I’ll look to see it go right through the bottom.”</p>

<p>When the interesting moment arrived, and
preparations to unload the heavy boxes had
been completed, six newcomers, apparently
having sprung from nowhere, stood around
and watched the proceedings with all the interest
which spectators generally show.</p>

<p>The seven boys and two men, after a great
deal of tugging and perspiring and straining
of muscles, succeeded in sliding several boxes
down a pair of heavy planks to the house-boat.
Then a block and tackle and a number
of thick timbers were thrown on top, and the
wagon rattled off.</p>

<p>The way Jack and his friends ripped and
tore apart the boxes would have been an inspiring
sight to some lazy boys. They forgot
the heat, labor—everything; and never paused
until a pile suitable for kindling wood lay on
the wharf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>“That was done fast, all right,” observed
Jim, mopping his brow. “Say, if my boss
was to see anything like that, he’d wonder
what he was payin’ me for. Well, now, that
engine is a mighty fine one.”</p>

<p>“We’re ready to get busy in earnest,” said
Jack, impatiently.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to. There’s a whole lot of
measurements we’ll need; and it’s got to be
done just right, you know.”</p>

<p>“Fire away,” was Jack’s eager reply.</p>

<p>“Wal,” said Jim, reflectively, walking out
on deck, “we can’t do the work here. That
tree over there is just about in the right
place; an’ here’s the block an’ tackle. We’ll
pass a rope ’round the whole shootin’ match.
Ye’re a strong-lookin’ lot, an’ it won’t take
long.”</p>

<p>“You bet it won’t,” said Bob Somers.</p>

<p>Ropes were quickly untied. Then the boys
set vigorously to work with long sweeps, and
soon succeeded in propelling the unwieldy
boat toward a shelving beach.</p>

<p>With Jim’s aid, the heavy block and tackle
was rigged to the tree, the rope passed around
the house-boat, and the five took hold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“A long pull, a strong pull, an’ a pull all
together,” commanded Jim. “Let ’er go!”</p>

<p>They tugged and pulled, while the perspiration
poured from them in streams, and, after
long and earnest efforts, the stern of the
“Gray Gull” was drawn up upon the beach.</p>

<p>“Now, what’s to be done?” cried Jack.</p>

<p>But it was several moments before Jim felt
capable of replying. He sighed, rubbed his
aching muscles, and at length said, with exasperating
slowness, “You see that there stern-post
in the middle? Wal, a hole’s got to be
bored in it for the shaft.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Jack. “Where shall we
place the engine?”</p>

<p>“We’ll make a bed frame on the cross-beams
below the deck. Have to tear up the plankin’
a bit.”</p>

<p>“What else?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“That’s all for the present. Take it easy;
a month from now you’ll forgit how much
time ye spent on puttin’ it in.” And with these
words of wisdom Jim clambered aboard, drew
out his rule, and began to take measurements.</p>

<p>“Right here,” he said, marking a square on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
the floor in the rear part of the cabin, “ye kin
take up them boards.”</p>

<p>The boys worked with a vim, using saw and
hatchet, and soon a large opening in the
planking revealed the cross-beams beneath.
Then they stood aside, while Jim indicated
where cuttings and borings had to be made.</p>

<p>“Make the frame right in place?” asked
Joe.</p>

<p>“Sure! I’m ready now to set in a couple
of them there beams. It’s goin’ to be a good,
solid foundation for the bed plate.”</p>

<p>Jack and Joe sawed two heavy pieces of
timber to the required length, and then bored
holes for the bolts.</p>

<p>“Tote ’em in now,” commanded Jim.</p>

<p>Following the mechanic’s directions, the
boys soon had the pieces resting at the proper
distance apart on the cross-beams; and Jim,
after considerable labor, succeeded in bolting
them securely in place.</p>

<p>“Now for a couple o’ crosspieces,” he added,
with a sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Solid as a rock,” declared the mechanic
at length, testing the timbers with his foot.
“Get the bed plate, an’ bolt it down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>When this was done, the five took a well-earned
rest; but it was for only a few moments.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll lower the engine into place, fellows,”
said Jack, jumping to his feet.</p>

<p>By means of an inclined board and ropes,
this was done; and Jim began to verify his
previous measurements.</p>

<p>“I got the angle o’ the propeller shaft just
right, lads,” he announced, holding a stick
from the engine to a mark he had made on the
stern-post. “The propeller o’ course has to
be a sufficient distance below the water level.”</p>

<p>“Won’t be much pitch to that shaft, eh?”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“No! I made it the least I could,” answered
the mechanic, wiping his face. “Too much
makes the boat lose speed.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bore the hole in the stern-post,” volunteered
Jack.</p>

<p>“Make it this size,” explained Jim, handing
the boy an auger. “It’s large enough to give
a clearance around the shaft.”</p>

<p>Jim watched the boy carefully, as the hole
had to be bored at exactly the right angle.
Several times he tested the slant with a long,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
straight piece of wood, and by this means accuracy
was assured.</p>

<p>No sooner had the task been accomplished
than Jim straightened himself up, and took
out his watch.</p>

<p>“Not another stroke to-night, young uns,”
he said. “It’s gittin’ on to six o’clock,
and——”</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious!” exclaimed Jack.
“It seems as if we hadn’t worked any time,
doesn’t it? Slow job, eh?”</p>

<p>Jim looked pained.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine way to talk,” he grumbled;
“an’ me with about twenty different kind o’
aches and pains.”</p>

<p>Jack slapped him on the back, and laughed.
“Cheer up, old man. Now mind you get
here early to-morrow morning; and we’ll
finish the job in great shape.”</p>

<p>“An’ me, too, I guess,” sighed Jim.</p>

<p>Time has a stubborn way of moving slowly
when the reverse is desired; and Joe insisted
that on the following morning the sun rose
fifty minutes late and that the hours were at
least twenty minutes too long; and Jack said
he was right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>But in spite of time’s apparent slowness,
the seven boys at length found themselves
again on the house-boat.</p>

<p>After an hour of tedious waiting Jim
Benton slowly approached.</p>

<p>“Here already?” he asked, with pretended
surprise.</p>

<p>Some very scornful and indignant looks rewarded
him; and Jim chuckled as he stepped
aboard the house-boat.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, “we won’t fasten nothin’
down till it’s tested from A to Z.”</p>

<p>“What comes first?” inquired Joe.</p>

<p>“Push the propeller shaft through the hole
in the stern-post; then if she fits, we’ll bolt
the stuffing box in place.”</p>

<p>“What’s a stuffing box?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“I know what a stuffing boy is,” laughed
Aleck, as he pointed to a sandwich from
which the other was taking huge bites.</p>

<p>“A metal cylinder fittin’ over the shaft,”
explained Jim. “It’s filled with packin’ to
keep out the water. Jack, you’re a hustler.
Bet you’d never work that hard for your
livin’, though.”</p>

<p>When the shaft had been put in place, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
coupling was attached to the end, and this in
turn bolted to a similar coupling on the engine.</p>

<p>“Pretty good work,” commented Jim.
“Now we’ll screw on the propeller; and then
back to the water it goes.”</p>

<p>The gasoline tank was installed; then the
batteries, spark coil, spark plugs and carburetor;
and their work now required only
testing.</p>

<p>“Bully job,” declared Jack, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Know how the engine works?” asked
Jim, stopping to wipe a very grimy face.</p>

<p>“Sure thing, Jim,” laughed Jack. “This
way: a mixture of gasoline vapor and air is
drawn into the cylinder from the carburetor;
the spark plug ignites it, and the piston is
forced downward.”</p>

<p>“It’s a number of explosions, one after another,”
put in Fred Winter, solemnly.</p>

<p>“The only thing I know about it is this,”
said Joe, with a grin; “when the engine
makes a noise, it’s going; and when it doesn’t,
it’s stopped.”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t it explode straight ahead?”
asked Aleck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>Jim Benton laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“’Cause the battery connection is broken,
young un,” he said. “An automatic arrangement
lets a spark shoot across at just the
right instant.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” said Aleck.</p>

<p>All but Jim Benton found it very hard to
stop work.</p>

<p>“I’m awful glad none of you fellers ain’t
my boss,” he said, dryly. “I ain’t worked
like this for many a day. Yes, I’ve ordered a
tank o’ gasoline; an’ it ought to be here
pretty soon.”</p>

<p>The fuel, however, was late in arriving; so,
leaving Joe in charge, the others set off to see
about provisions for the trip. Jim Benton
accompanied them.</p>

<p>“Don’t see why they asked me to stay,”
grumbled Joe, dangling his legs over the
wharf. “Gee whiz, here comes the stuff now.”</p>

<p>A wagon drew up.</p>

<p>“Hey!” said the driver.</p>

<p>“Hey yourself!” said Joe, pleasantly.
“Trot off your old gasoline.”</p>

<p>“All right, bub!” And the man began
unloading a number of cans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>Joe soon had these aboard the “Gray Gull,”
and then began filling the tank. But a little
labor went a great way with Joe, and he
quickly tired. The attraction offered by his
lunch box was not to be resisted.</p>

<p>“Must be enough in the old thing to take
us to Albany,” he grumbled. “I’ll put in
some more to-night.”</p>

<p>When the boys appeared he greeted them
by exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Everything’s all right, fellows.”</p>

<p>“Gasoline in the tank, too?” asked Jack,
with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“You bet.”</p>

<p>“Shove off. We’ll soon find out how the
engine works.”</p>

<p>A loud, long cheer went up as the fly-wheel
began to revolve.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” yelled Jack. “Isn’t this
great?”</p>

<p>“Going like a thing o’ life,” grinned Joe.</p>

<p>“Speed ’most makes a fellow dizzy,” smiled
Bob.</p>

<p>“The only thing I’m surprised at is to find
the boat going at all,” remarked Dave Brandon,
staring solemnly at the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>After skirting the shore for a short distance
Jim swung the boat around, and she slowly
chugged her way back to the starting-point.</p>

<p>“It’s all in good shape, young uns,” he remarked,
with a smile of satisfaction. “Wish’t
I was going along.”</p>

<p>“Mighty glad it’s been decided that we
house-boat it,” chirped Tom. “Dandy fun.
I’m glad your father didn’t object, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Bet you’ll scrap about the bunks,” said
Jim.</p>

<p>“Not on your life.” Tom Clifton laughed.
“Why, we’ll just roll ourselves up in blankets
and flop down in any old corner.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you Ramblers ever sleep in beds?”
queried Jim, with a wink.</p>

<p>“Only sometimes,” answered Tom, loftily.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll start on our trip to-morrow,”
declared Jack Lyons, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” sighed Joe, “is an awful
long way off.”</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">“ALL ABOARD!”</p>


<p>Time did, indeed, seem to move with exasperating
slowness. None of the impatient
boys slept very well that night, and each
arose next morning almost with the sun.</p>

<p>At an early hour, a group had assembled
on the ordinarily deserted wharf. There
were, of course, all the boys, Mr. John
Lyons, Sr., Mr. George Somers, Bob’s father,
little Bobby Lyons, Jack’s brother, and Mr.
Montague Winter, besides other near and
distant relatives.</p>

<p>Mr. Lyons, jolly and smiling, examined
every corner of the boat, gave bits of useful
advice, and sought to allay the fears of Mr.
Winter.</p>

<p>“I don’t consider it a very safe trip,” exclaimed
the latter, nervously. “There is
danger of their being run down by the big
boats.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“But, my dear sir, they have eyes to look
out for such dangers.”</p>

<p>“Then, again, the Hudson is no mill-pond,
and in case of storms——”</p>

<p>“Depend upon it, the boys will be safely
anchored near shore,” laughed Mr. Lyons.
“Jack has promised me to be careful.”</p>

<p>“They will have to stop over night in
some pretty lonely localities, and rough characters
may molest them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Somers smiled.</p>

<p>“I do not think you need have any fears,
Mr. Winter,” he said, reassuringly. “Jack
and his friends are old enough to look out
for themselves, Bob is used to boats, and a
trip of this sort should do them a world of
good.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope so, at any rate,” said Fred’s
father, still a trifle nervously.</p>

<p>The seven boys were dressed for solid comfort,
and had brought with them boots,
leggins and sweaters. The first flush of
excitement over, it was noticed that Fred
Winter wore a broad-brimmed felt hat of uncertain
age.</p>

<p>“I say——” whispered Joe. “Why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>“I’m not going to get my face burned to a
blister—that’s why. You’ll catch it from the
sun and reflections in the water. Better chuck
those caps away, and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, that peaches and cream complexion!”
gurgled Joe.</p>

<p>The supreme moment had come. The near
and distant relatives poured forth a steady
stream of advice and admonition. Several
curious loungers, all wearing broad grins,
added a word now and then, and the boys
had their own troubles in trying to hear as
little as possible.</p>

<p>“All aboard!” commanded Jack.</p>

<p>At last the captain of the house-boat was
actually casting off the lines.</p>

<p>Little Bobby Lyons almost danced with
excitement.</p>

<p>“Jack, Jack—don’t forget that letter you’re
going to send me,” he called. “And, Jack,
be sure to—oh, dear, there’s something else I
wanted to say to you, and—I can’t think of
it.”</p>

<p>“Send a message by wireless,” laughed Joe.
“Everything clear, Jack? That’s good! Now
start ’er going.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“Looks like Miles Standish’s cabin,” remarked
a bystander.</p>

<p>“Them there lads has plenty of go,” said
another.</p>

<p>“That’s more’n the boat will ever have,”
grinned a third.</p>

<p>It was an interesting moment. Captain
Jack’s hand rested on the fly-wheel, and he
looked at his chums.</p>

<p>“Quick, give it a turn!” cried Joe, with
suspense in his tone.</p>

<p>Jack obeyed, and a series of rapid reports
immediately followed, bringing forth a round
of cheers.</p>

<p>No music could have sounded sweeter to
the boys than the chug-chug which was carried
away on the breeze.</p>

<p>As the house-boat slowly swung out into
the stream, the seven shouted again. Good-byes
shot back and forth; Mr. Lyons, Mr.
Somers and Mr. Winter waved their hands;
the loungers shouted and laughed—the voyage
was begun.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this immense?” said Jack, gleefully,
as he turned on full power. “Bet some of
those chaps on the wharf wish they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
going. What’s that, Joe? Sure, we’ll cross
the Hudson—get right over to the Jersey side.
Keep your eyes open, fellows,—we don’t want
to sink any steamers.”</p>

<p>“Keep a sharp watch for icebergs,” said
Bob. “Remember the ‘Titanic.’”</p>

<p>“Look at the land skipping by,” cried Fred.
“Bet we’re going all of three miles an hour.”</p>

<p>The blue water lapped and gurgled against
the boat, and a gentle breeze tempered the
heat. White clouds were slowly passing
across the sky, and shadows chased each
other over land and water. To their left
rose Washington Heights, and to the right
another ridge of hills was outlined against
the sky. Houses dotted the landscape, and
smoke stained and streaked the horizon.</p>

<p>“Ja-ck, Jaa-ck!” came floating over the
air; “Jaaa-ck!”</p>

<p>“What’s up now?” cried Jack. “Wonder
what little Bobby wants.”</p>

<p>“Ja-a-a-ck,—Ja-a-a-a-ck!”</p>

<p>“Better swing around, and see,” counseled
Bob Somers.</p>

<p>“Ja-a-a-a-ck, Ja-a-a-a-a-ck!”</p>

<p>“Whee, what a howl!” said Aleck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“Settles it, anyway,” laughed Jack, as he
followed Bob’s advice.</p>

<p>Laboriously the “Gray Gull” began to turn
around, and was finally headed for the wharf.
The figures on it began to grow more distinct.</p>

<p>Then came Bobby’s shrill voice again:</p>

<p>“Jack, I remember now what I wanted—send
me some picture postal cards.”</p>

<p>And Joe slapped Jack on the back; and
Jack laughed heartily, and yelled back, “All
right, Bobby!” And again the course of the
“Gray Gull” was changed, and soon the
wharf and the figures grew faint again.</p>

<p>Keeping close inshore, the “Gray Gull”
was often rocked by the long swells from
passing craft. The Harlem River presented
quite a busy scene, although they were beyond
the portion where the traffic is greatest.</p>

<p>Occasionally, they were hailed from the
deck of some barge or schooner, and the
occupants of a motor boat speeding swiftly by
gave a series of derisive yells. But the boys
only laughed, and waved their hands, feeling
that they wouldn’t exchange the “Gray Gull”
for all the gasoline launches in New York.</p>

<p>Joe, sweeping the landscape with Dave’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
telescope, uttered so many exclamations of
surprise and pleasure that Aleck promptly
wrested the glass from his hands.</p>

<p>“Where, which and what?” he asked.</p>

<p>“All three, kind sir,” answered Joe. “But
that electric car on Washington Heights looms
up strangely large. Somebody on it just
dropped a coin.”</p>

<p>Aleck looked rather puzzled, that is until
the speaker added, “Hurry up and see if he
finds it. Looked to me like a nickel of the
year twelve hundred and six.”</p>

<p>Aleck Hunt raised the glass to his eyes.</p>

<p>“Hey! Did you ever see such a wobble?”
he exclaimed. “Wouldn’t like to be on a car
swinging around like that. This glass makes
my arms ache, too; and it’s all out of focus.
Want it back?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Joe, incautiously.</p>

<p>“Then you can’t have it,” returned Aleck,
as he once more raised the telescope.</p>

<p>“Better keep her out a bit, Cap’n Jack,”
yelled Joe Preston. “Unless you want to
climb the hill.”</p>

<p>And Jack, becoming a little bolder, swung
the “Gray Gull” further out into the stream.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Fred presently relieved him at the tiller.
Then the others took their turns.</p>

<p>On the “promenade deck,” as Jack soon
christened it, Confuse-us, feeling no doubt
that the occasion was one of great importance,
ambled from side to side, gazing curiously at
the lapping water which splashed and gurgled
so close beneath his nose.</p>

<p>Time passed quickly, each moment bringing
something to attract their attention.</p>

<p>“Brick barges from Haverstraw,” announced
Jack, presently, as a tug, moving at a snail’s
pace, puffed laboriously along. A column of
inky smoke swirled aloft, leaving a long trail
to slowly dissipate itself in the clear atmosphere
above, while jets of steam gleamed in
the sunlight. Each of the clumsy barges was
loaded high with bricks, and seemed reluctant
to follow the valiant little tug.</p>

<p>As the morning advanced, the breeze
slightly increased; the white clouds grew
thicker, piling themselves up into great
rounded masses, and the swift changes over
the landscape, from glancing light to fleeting
shadow, were pleasing to look upon.</p>

<p>“Cap’n Jack,” remarked Joe, suddenly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
“are we going to stop for lunch, or eat it
on the wide waste of water?”</p>

<p>“No stops till the Jersey shore is reached,”
answered Jack Lyons, decidedly.</p>

<p>“Right you are,” said Fred. “Joe is always
thinking of meal-time. But, please,
Aleck, trot out the sardines and crackers, the
cheese and home-made pickles, the pound
cake and everything else we have.”</p>

<p>And Aleck did. So all but Jack sat on
deck and talked and ate, and idly watched
the water foaming and bubbling away from
the stern, while Confuse-us, fully alive to the
occasion, trotted from one to another, and,
with plaintive wails, begged for his share of
the good things.</p>

<p>Finally, an indignant voice came from
Jack, at the tiller.</p>

<p>“Say, do you fellows intend to eat all that
grub?” he demanded.</p>

<p>The others looked at each other rather
guiltily and meekly said that they didn’t.
But each waited for the other to get up, and
not until Joe, Aleck and Tom were forcibly
ousted from their position did Jack come in
for his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“Sure as guns, we’re getting near the Hudson,”
remarked Fred, an hour later. “It’s
right around that bend.”</p>

<p>“Can’t get there too soon for me,” said
Aleck. “And—and——” He drew a long
breath.</p>

<p>“And what?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“I won’t be sorry to get across. It’s pretty
wide, you know, and this floating log cabin is
a good mark for——”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! Aleck’s getting scared already,”
laughed Joe.</p>

<p>“I am not, and——”</p>

<p>“Hello, boys—the Hudson!”</p>

<p>Jack’s voice rang out cheerily, as he peered
ahead and caught a glimpse of a broad expanse
of water, framed in by a wall of frowning
cliffs on the Jersey shore.</p>

<p>“And just think,” said Fred, in a reflective
tone, as he pointed toward a tree-covered slope
on the left, “that’s the end of Manhattan
Island, one of the most remarkable places in
the world.”</p>

<p>“Got that sentence out of a book, didn’t
you?” inquired Dave with a smile.</p>

<p>Slowly, the “Gray Gull” chugged its way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
toward the greater river. The boys looked
eagerly about them. At the point of junction,
the Harlem is spanned by a railroad bridge,
and just as the house-boat reached it a heavy
freight train rumbled overhead.</p>

<p>“Glad I’m not on it,” observed Tommy
Clifton, with a wink. “Must be fierce to go
poking along like that.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz, doesn’t the Hudson look
wide!” exclaimed Jack, shading his eyes.
“Lots of boats to steer clear of, too. What’s
that, Bob? All the power is on, my boy.
We can’t go any faster, unless you get out and
push.”</p>

<p>Gradually the house-boat drew away from
the hills on either hand, and was headed directly
across the river. The sunlight, streaming
between a break in the clouds, reflected in
the water, which the freshening breeze had
kicked up into choppy waves. They tumbled
against the sides of the craft with a strange,
melancholy swish. Now and then shining
drops splashed over the bow, and Confuse-us
hastily retired within.</p>

<p>“Looks an awful distance across,” remarked
Jack, again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“We’re so close to the water—that’s why,”
said Dave Brandon. “But doesn’t it seem
lonely out here, fellows?”</p>

<p>“And take a squint at those sea-gulls,”
added Joe, pointing toward a flock of birds
circling above.</p>

<p>The Hudson greatly impressed the boys
with its vastness. The river, viewed from a
height of only a few feet, presented a very
different picture from the one so familiar to
passengers on excursion and ferry-boats.</p>

<p>A vague sense of danger stole over the occupants
of the house-boat. The little craft
rocked gently, and they could well imagine
how, in case of a squall, it would be at the
mercy of the foam-crested waves. However,
such thoughts soon vanished. The smell of
the water was pleasant, and the boys, leaning
comfortably against the side of the boat,
sniffed the air with keen pleasure.</p>

<p>Straight ahead, a big, lumbering schooner
slowly made its way down the river, the
breeze being just sufficient to fill out her dingy
gray sails. Shouts and commands reached
their ears with astonishing clearness, even
above the steady chug-chug of the motor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“Nice mess we’d be in, if the engine should
break down,” remarked Aleck.</p>

<p>“If anything is going to happen, now’s the
time,” said Tom. “We’re just about in the
middle of the river.”</p>

<p>A big excursion steamer was passing astern.
Many passengers, crowding to the rails,
watched the house-boat with every evidence of
interest. Several waved their hands and
shouted, and the boys answered with yells
and whistles and all the noise of which they
were capable, until the boat began to rock and
wobble on the heavy swells.</p>

<p>“Thunderation!” exclaimed Joe, loudly.</p>

<p>His stool had flown from under him; and
Joe, wildly grasping at the empty air, sprawled
full length on the deck, and but for Dave’s
prompt assistance would have rolled into the
river.</p>

<p>“Jiminy!” panted the boy, picking himself
up, rather red and confused.</p>

<p>“Came near being a good cold bath for
one,” grinned Aleck. And all laughed but
the victim.</p>

<p>The bold, rocky forms of the Palisades
began to stand out clearly. At their base and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
part way up the slope were masses of trees
and vegetation; but the general appearance
was that of an almost vertical wall, now glistening
in the sunlight, then deep in shadow.
The cliffs looked so big and grand that all
were impressed.</p>

<p>“I tell you what,” remarked Jack, after a
long survey, “it’s a mighty good thing the
quarrymen were stopped from blasting those
rocks. I heard father say they were doing
enormous damage, and spoiling the——”</p>

<p>“Natural beauty of the scene,” suggested
Joe.</p>

<p>“That’s it. A whole lot of people got together
after a while and persuaded the authorities
to make a big slice of the Palisades into a
public park. It’s dandy up there.”</p>

<p>Numbers of swift motor boats were going
up and down, and the sound of rapid pulsations
filled the air. Along the shore, at
intervals, the white tents of campers-out
flashed between the trees; and streamers of
bluish smoke floated slowly in front of the
rocks. It was a picturesque and beautiful
scene.</p>

<p>When about three hundred feet from shore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Jack changed his course, heading up the
river.</p>

<p>The “Gray Gull” attracted considerable
attention; the campers-out gathered at the
water’s edge, and their yells were answered
with interest; the occupants of passing motor
boats beamed upon them with kindly condescension.</p>

<p>“Those fellows think they’re the biggest
things on the river,” grinned Joe; “but give
me the ‘Gray Gull’ every time.”</p>

<p>“Me, too,” said Tom. “Plenty of room to
move around in, and all the comforts of home.”</p>

<p>“Swell, eh?” said Aleck.</p>

<p>“That’s the word for it,” answered Joe.
“Dandy place to camp, over there; but if we
want to reach Albany before the summer’s
over, we can’t do much of that.”</p>

<p>“One thing is going to help us, though,”
put in Fred.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“The tide.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes—so it will; and keep us back,
too, when it’s running out.”</p>

<p>“Not if we time our stops the way we
ought to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“If you fellows wish, I can figure out just
how it changes. I think there’s about an
hour’s difference every day.”</p>

<p>“That’s knowledge for you,” laughed Jack.
“Don’t wonder you wear glasses, and forget
to smile at times, old chap.”</p>

<p>“It’s one of the terrible effects of deep
thought,” grinned Joe. “But still, I should
say so much brain work isn’t necessary just
now. We’ll drop in a string—if it floats
down—well—it follows——”</p>

<p>“The tide,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Aristotle would have envied such reasoning
as that,” laughed Dave Brandon. “What
a relief to know that the weighty problem is
settled.”</p>

<p>Becoming emboldened by the ease with
which he handled the “Gray Gull,” Jack decided
to venture further out into the stream.</p>

<p>For half an hour they had kept their
course, when Fred Winter adjusted his glasses,
and, looking straight ahead, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“That tug is coming along mighty fast;
which side do you suppose it will pass?”</p>

<p>“H’m,” said Jack, rather doubtfully, “they
must look out for themselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>Two short, sharp whistles suddenly sounded;
and the boys looked at each other and the
swiftly approaching tug in some apprehension.</p>

<p>“What does that signal mean?” asked
Fred, nervously.</p>

<p>No one answered; Jack seemed puzzled;
but something had to be done quickly, as the
“Gray Gull” was almost directly in line.
With a quick movement, he steered to starboard,
just as the tug swung to port.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” yelled Joe, excitedly. “We’re
going to get smashed to bits.”</p>

<p>A chorus of exclamations rang out, blending
in with another sharp signal from the
tug.</p>

<p>“What’s to be done?” gasped Aleck Hunt,
in dismay.</p>

<p>It was a moment of great excitement.
None understood the commands which were
hurled over the air; it seemed as if nothing
could prevent the two craft from coming together.
The dismayed boys stood almost
motionless, while the black hull cut swiftly
toward them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jack Lyons, realizing what was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
to be done, swung the tiller far around;
quick action of those on the tug sent its
prow outward.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” breathed Jack.</p>

<p>So close that his hand outstretched could
have touched it, the tug passed abreast; then
the “Gray Gull” began to bob up and down
on the waves.</p>

<p>The engine of the “Gray Gull” had been
reversed, and it was coming to a stop.</p>

<p>“That was a narrow escape,” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“I should say so,” said Jack, in shaky
tones.</p>

<p>“Hey! What’s the matter with you fellers?”</p>

<p>A grizzly, weather-beaten man leaning over
the rail of the tug was glaring sternly toward
them.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know anything about river
signals?” demanded the other, sharply.</p>

<p>“No—that is——” began Jack, in some
confusion.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” said the captain, grimly.
Then, as his eyes took in the pleasing appearance
of the lads, his tone softened. “Yer
want ter l’arn ’em, young fellers,” he counseled.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
“It’s risky enough on the water without
not havin’ no knowledge o’ them things.
Stick what I’m goin’ ter tell yer in them
noddles of yourn; an’ don’t let it git out—understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” chorused his hearers.</p>

<p>“Wal, one short whistle means we’re goin’
ter starboard; two of ’em says steerin’ ter
port; and three, engine is reversed. Don’t
forgit it, now.”</p>

<p>“No siree; we’ll write it down,” said Jack.
“Jolly well obliged to you, sir.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, young feller. Whar’ are
ye bound?”</p>

<p>“To Albany.”</p>

<p>The captain guffawed loudly; and several
of his crew laughed, also.</p>

<p>“Wal, mebbe ye’ll git thar this year, an’
mebbe ye won’t,” he said. “Good v’y’ge an’
pleasant weather!” And, with a wave of his
big hand, the captain turned away, for the tug
“Juno” was again in motion.</p>

<p>“Dandy fellow, that,” commented Jack.
“We’ve learned something, too.”</p>

<p>“But nearly had our trip ended before it
was begun,” added Dave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>The late afternoon found them opposite
Yonkers. Factories lined the water-front;
and the town, rising on a hill beyond and
bathed in a mellow glow, formed a picturesque
background.</p>

<p>“Let’s anchor here,” said Jack. “Tide’s
running in fast; but we don’t need to get excited
about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Joe. “Grub time can’t
be made to wait for anything less than an
earthquake or cyclone.”</p>

<p>“I’ll cook to-night,” went on Jack. “Your
turn to-morrow, Joe. Scat, Confuse-us!
What’s that, Joe? Do you want a menu
card? I’ll write one out, and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, hang the ‘me knew’ card, you silly
amateur pirate,” said Joe. “If me knew, I
wouldn’t have asked. Tell us gently what
it’s going to be.”</p>

<p>“Sing it to him,” grinned Aleck. “Say,
that’s a nice little launch coming across.”</p>

<p>“It’s the ferry,” explained Jack, with an
air of superior wisdom. “Runs between
Yonkers and this big pile of rocks,—been on
it often.”</p>

<p>The “Gray Gull” was run nearer the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
shore; then Jack shut off power, and, a minute
later, the anchor was heaved overboard
and disappeared with a tremendous splash in
the rippling water.</p>

<p>Deep shadows were soon stealing over the
landscape; and the towering crags outlined
themselves against golden clouds and pearly
green sky.</p>

<p>When dusk came, Jack lighted the lanterns.</p>

<p>“I know one thing about this river business,
anyway,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Surprised to hear it,” said Joe, cheerfully.</p>

<p>“If I didn’t want to show my knowledge,
I wouldn’t tell you, after that,” laughed Jack.
“This green light goes on the starboard side,
red on the port, and white placed forward.”</p>

<p>“Looks fine,” commented Tom Clifton
when the lanterns were in position. “Makes
me feel like a real mariner.”</p>

<p>When the lantern which hung from the
middle of the ceiling had been lighted, the
interior of the house-boat seemed doubly attractive.</p>

<p>Jack proved himself to be a good chef; and
the others praised his cooking with an earnestness
that amounted to enthusiasm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>After supper, it was voted too late to go
ashore; but Bob Somers’ suggestion that the
voyage be continued was acted upon, in spite
of a protest from Fred.</p>

<p>“Oh, sugar!” he said. “Why not let’s
read? I brought some dandy books along;
but who in the dickens could enjoy ’em with
that engine making such a thundering racket?”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother your old books,” said Joe.
“I’ve got something better than that.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to write a history of the trip.”</p>

<p>“Goodness; my job as historian is threatened,”
murmured Dave.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! A history of the trip?”</p>

<p>“Certainly! Why not?”</p>

<p>“Begin to-night, eh?”</p>

<p>“No—to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!”</p>

<p>And the rest began to chuckle and gurgle,
and Joe scornfully walked out on the promenade
deck, closely followed by Confuse-us.</p>

<p>The moon shone brightly, and a cool, refreshing
breeze came from the west. Masses
of clouds, now gray and solemn-looking, rested
in the rapidly darkening sky. Yonkers was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
aglow with lights. Singly and in clusters,
they flashed from the line of hills and along
the water-front. As Joe sat down, he heard
the whistle of a locomotive and saw one of
the New York Central trains skirting the
river. At the base of the Palisades, a lone
camp-fire spurted tongues of flame against
the gloom beyond, and the sighing breeze
brought with it the sound of voices.</p>

<p>“Up anchor, fellows,” commanded Captain
Jack. “Guess we can make a mile or two.”</p>

<p>Willing hands seized the chain, and, with a
rattle and bang and lots of unnecessary noise,
the anchor was dragged aboard.</p>

<p>“Great difference between the night and
day,” remarked Aleck.</p>

<p>“You bet—it’s darker,” said Tom, with a
grin.</p>

<p>“If I weren’t jealous of such brilliant conversation,
I’d help it along by asking which
is darker?” observed Fred Winter. “Say,
you chaps certainly do waste a lot of words
over nothing.”</p>

<p>“Correct,” put in Joe, “and here’s another
sample. Kind o’ queer-looking on the river—pretty
black, at times, I guess. Never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
struck me before how hard it must be to
pilot a big steamer on a pitch dark night.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think I should care to try it,” said
Fred, with a slight shiver.</p>

<p>A bit out, the waves were choppy, and the
dory at the stern bobbed merrily up and
down. The moon played hide-and-seek with
the silver-edged clouds, and threw a strange,
weird light over the landscape.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll tell you that story I heard now,
fellows,” remarked Aleck Hunt. “Say, Jack,
you know Joe Archer, the chap who played
short-stop on our baseball team—well——”</p>

<p>“Hello, what’s the matter?” interrupted
Jack.</p>

<p>The pulsations of the motor had suddenly
ceased.</p>

<p class="ph3">A VOICE IN THE NIGHT</p>


<p>Captain Jack stepped inside, with an exclamation,
and gave the fly-wheel a twist.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with the thing?” queried
Bob Somers.</p>

<p>“Don’t know yet,” answered Jack, his tone
betraying a trace of anxiety, “but I’ll find out
in a jiffy—have to; the tide’s carrying us
right out, and it’s a risky business floating
around on the river at this time o’ night.
Get outside, Joe, and keep your eyes peeled.”</p>

<p>Jack set to work. He first tested the batteries,
and found them in working order, then
examined the spark plugs.</p>

<p>“Nothing the matter there,” he remarked,
in a perplexed tone.</p>

<p>“Feed pipe all right?” asked Aleck.</p>

<p>“Of course it’s all right.”</p>

<p>“How about the carburetor?” said Dave.</p>

<p>“Can’t see anything wrong with that; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
I’m not going to take it apart unless I have
to.”</p>

<p>“Try the engine again,” suggested Bob,
after they had spent some little time upon it.</p>

<p>Jack did so; but the only result was one
faint report.</p>

<p>“Very queer,” he mused.</p>

<p>“All right?” called a voice from outside.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” responded Jack; “except that
it won’t go.”</p>

<p>Jack threw himself upon the bench, and
started to think it out. While thus engaged,
and, for the moment, quite oblivious to his
surroundings, he was startled by exclamations
from his chums.</p>

<p>“Hey there!” shouted Joe in excited tones,
as he suddenly popped his head inside.
“Somebody out on the river yelling for help—listen!”</p>

<p>The boys made a concerted dash for the
deck, just as a faint cry floated over the air.</p>

<p>“By Jingo, I wonder what that means!”
cried Bob, looking eagerly around. “Which
side does it come from?—Hello; I see something
out there.”</p>

<p>“Where—where?” chorused the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>“Right to the left of Yonkers. Jiminy,
the moon had to go back of a cloud just at the
wrong time.”</p>

<p>“Help!”</p>

<p>The cry again caused their nerves to tingle,
and all strained their eyes in the direction
which Bob pointed out.</p>

<p>As a flood of pale moonlight once more
streamed between the clouds, a dark object
could be seen not more than a quarter of a
mile away.</p>

<p>“That’s it, sure enough!” cried Aleck
excitedly. “Looks like a rowboat. Somebody
may be in a pretty bad pickle, and no
boats near enough to help him. If our engine
was only all right, we might get there in time
ourselves. There, he hollered again.”</p>

<p>“What’s to be done?” asked Joe, blankly.</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other and shook
their heads. Then Bob Somers’ lips suddenly
tightened and an expression came over his
face which the Ramblers knew from experience
meant a determined resolve.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” he said, quickly, “I’m going
out in the dory. We can’t stand around and
not try to help him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>“Good boy,” said Joe. “That’s the idea
exactly. Let me go along, eh?”</p>

<p>But Bob shook his head.</p>

<p>“Can’t, Joe,” he answered, laconically.
“Not room enough. Do what you can with
the engine, Jack, and all keep a sharp lookout.
I’m off. What’s that?”</p>

<p>A faint ray of light suddenly flashed its way
through the darkness, slowly moved up and
down, then swung around and disappeared.</p>

<p>“Search-light,” cried Bob, hurriedly.
“Some steamer coming along—yes, there it is.
See—away off? But I can’t wait.”</p>

<p>He dashed inside, seized the oars, while Joe
Preston hauled in the rope and the dory was
brought alongside.</p>

<p>Bob speedily clambered in and set a lantern
in the bow, then with the aid of an oar,
shoved off.</p>

<p>“Look out for yourself,” cried Jack Lyons.
“For goodness’ sake, be careful.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother about me, fellows,” said Bob,
cheerily, and he bent to the oars, while his excited
friends watched the dory melting into
the darkness, the lantern reflecting in erratic,
wriggling lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>Bob pulled with long, steady strokes.
Every ounce of strength in his muscular
arms was brought into play, and in a few
moments the house-boat assumed a strange,
weird appearance in the gloom. He could
still hear the voices of his chums, and yelled
a cheery, “All right, fellows,” then strove with
might and main, as another call for assistance
was borne to his ears.</p>

<p>The choppy water lapped and gurgled, and
the dory’s sharp bow plunging in sent a
shower of drops flying aboard. It was all
very dark and mysterious on the river and a
strange sense of loneliness stole over the
young skipper. The waves were higher now,
and as they bore down upon the frail craft its
occupant was forced to carefully judge his
strokes.</p>

<p>Again the ray of the search-light flashed
across the water and a glance over his shoulder
enabled him to get a clear view of the approaching
steamboat.</p>

<p>“If the sky were only clear, it would be
twice as easy,” he murmured. “Still, I
haven’t much further to go. Whew, this is
quite an adventure for the first day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>The rowboat was not far ahead now, and,
as the moon again appeared in view, Bob saw
in it a man waving his arms.</p>

<p>“I’ll be with you in a minute,” he yelled,
and an answering shout floated over the
water.</p>

<p>But the last stretch dragged out, and when,
with aching arms and panting breath, Bob
neared the boatman in distress, the steamer
with the flaring search-light was not far away.</p>

<p>“You’re just in time,” called the man, over
the intervening space. “My old boat sprung
a leak and is half full of water.”</p>

<p>His voice was pleasant and youthful, and
when the rays of the lantern fell across him,
Bob saw the good-looking, clear-cut features
of a man about twenty-one.</p>

<p>“By George, I owe you a debt of gratitude,”
he cried, in a tone of great relief. “I’m not
much of a swimmer.”</p>

<p>He laughed, nervously, then paused and
looked at Bob in surprise.</p>

<p>“Why!” he exclaimed, “I—never—expected
to——” and he stopped again.</p>

<p>“Expected what?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, to speak frankly, I’m surprised to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
see a boy. Where in the world did you come
from?”</p>

<p>“We—that is some fellows and myself—have
a house-boat over there,” explained Bob,
waving his hand. “See those lights over
there? That’s it. Heard you shout, but
couldn’t come over because the engine’s out of
order.”</p>

<p>“In search of adventures,” laughed the
young man, who seemed to have recovered
from his scare.</p>

<p>“Yes, and this is number one,” grinned
Bob. “Be careful when you climb aboard—this
dory’s a cranky little boat—mighty easy
to upset.”</p>

<p>“And we must look out for the swells from
that steamer. Guess it’s one of the Albany
boats.”</p>

<p>Bob skilfully paddled close to the sinking
boat and glanced at the steamer not a hundred
yards away. Her windows were aglow
with lights and the water close by quivered
and shook like molten gold. A powerful
search-light cut its way against the blackness,
and Bob uttered an exclamation as its rays
suddenly swept across the rugged face of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
Palisades, bringing out their forms with
strange sharpness against the clouded sky.</p>

<p>As yet, the young man had made no move
to clamber aboard, and Bob rightly guessed
that he was waiting until the swells due from
the steamer should have subsided.</p>

<p>For the moment, the weird pictures brought
into view by the search-light held him in a
spell. Alternating lights and shadows played
fantastically over the rocks. Then it vanished.
Deep gloom again enfolded the cliffs, and the
search-light, slowly sweeping across the dark
river, picked out the familiar form of the
“Gray Gull.”</p>

<p>“Look!” gasped Bob, in delight.</p>

<p>There, bathed in the electric beams, the
strange-looking house-boat could be seen,
floating out on the tide. As if those on the
steamer wished to study such an unusual
sight, the light was played upon it for several
moments. Then the night suddenly covered
it again.</p>

<p>Having had his eyes fixed steadily on the
search-light, Bob found that his surroundings
assumed a very black and forbidding appearance.
The waves splashed and lapped with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
peculiar, monotonous chant, and over the air
came the river noises, the puffing of tugs and
whistles of various boats in the distance.</p>

<p>As the dory answered to the call of the
choppy masses, Bob thought of his situation,
adrift on the great Hudson. How strange and
mysterious it seemed, with both shores lost in
the gloom of night.</p>

<p>“Look alive there; it’s coming!”</p>

<p>A long roller was rushing shoreward, followed
by a succession of others. Bob saw
them looming dimly in the half-obscured
moonlight. The foremost seemed to glimmer
for an instant, then the dory was carried high
over its foaming crest and plunged down on
the other side, to meet another which sent it
heeling almost to the gunwale, while drenching
spray dashed over the skipper.</p>

<p>For an instant, the water battled with
fury against the frail craft, but Bob Somers’
arms were sturdy, and he managed to keep
the dory headed toward the waves. Soon the
violent wobbling ceased, and he pulled alongside
the other boat.</p>

<p>“I’m just as wet as you are, now,” he said,
with a smile, “even though we’re not in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
same boat,” and Bob chuckled at his own witticism.
“Ready? I’ve got her tight.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ready now,” answered the stranger.</p>

<p>He stepped lightly from one boat into the
other. Then Bob quickly fastened a line to
the water-logged craft.</p>

<p>“I certainly am thankful for your timely
aid,” said the young man, extending his hand.
“Perhaps I oughtn’t to admit it, but I was getting
pretty badly scared. I was afraid that
my boat might go down at any minute. I’m
completely played out—couldn’t make any
headway at all. My name is Norman Redfern.”</p>

<p>Bob introduced himself and, in a few words,
explained about their trip.</p>

<p>“How did your boat happen to spring a
leak?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But I noticed a bit of
water coming in when I rowed over to Yonkers.
It wasn’t much, and I thought it had
merely splashed over the side. Coming back,
though, it got worse and I finally decided that
if any one was within hearing distance I
needed his help.”</p>

<p>“Glad we heard you,” said Bob, heartily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>Progress with the other boat in tow was
very slow, and the boy’s arms began to ache.
He cast many a glance over his shoulder, to
note the position of the “Gray Gull,” which
was revealed by the lanterns.</p>

<p>“Hard work, eh?” remarked Norman.
“Let me give you a hand.”</p>

<p>But Bob shook his head and pulled away,
while the perspiration poured over his face.</p>

<p>“Listen!” he exclaimed presently. “Listen!”</p>

<p>A steady chug-chug suddenly started up,
and the faint lights began to slowly move
toward them.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that great?” panted Bob, gleefully.
“Hooray! We’ll just wait for ’em on the
bosom of the rolling deep.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” assented the other.</p>

<p>And Bob, lolling back, watched the house-boat’s
lights growing brighter with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Hello, fellows!” he yelled, with all the
strength of his lusty lungs; and a chorus
of voices immediately answered from the
distance.</p>

<p>In a short time, the “Gray Gull” loomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
up close at hand, and a loud cheer arose when
the eager boys saw Bob and his companion
safe and sound. The pulsation of the engine
ceased, and the house-boat came to a stop.
Then the two were helped aboard, while Confuse-us,
alarmed at the noise, fled in terror to
the darkest corner.</p>

<p>Mutual explanations and introductions followed.</p>

<p>“What was the matter with the engine?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Nothing. The supply of gasoline gave
out, and but for those extra cans we might
have floated for—well, put it down at as
many days as you like.”</p>

<p>Fred Winter laughed, then added, “Joe
Preston was going to see that it was full, and,
of course——”</p>

<p>“Forgot,” finished Joe, not in the least disturbed.
“Next time I’m going to sublet my
contract. Hard work doesn’t agree—well
say, Bob, what’s the matter—waves out there
mountain high, or just a cloudburst?”</p>

<p>Then the whole story had to come out, and
a ripple of mirth went around the room.</p>

<p>As the rescued boatman stood in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
brightly-lighted interior of the house-boat, the
four saw that he was a very good-looking young
man of slight build. His refined speech and
manner were in striking contrast to his worn
and threadbare clothes.</p>

<p>He was enthusiastic about the house-boat
trip.</p>

<p>“I wish I were going with you,” he said
rather wistfully. “If you use your eyes to
advantage a great deal can be learned. Travel
broadens one’s views, and even in a short trip
of this sort habits of self-reliance are formed.
How far are you going—to Albany, eh?”</p>

<p>The smile on his face suddenly vanished,
and he gazed reflectively at the floor.</p>

<p>“Know the city?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Yes, very well. It’s a nice town, and
I——” He stopped short and looked at his
watch, then added, “Hello! What’s that in
the corner—a telescope?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Fred. “Some night we’re
going to have a look at the stars.”</p>

<p>Norman Redfern seemed greatly interested;
he walked over, picked up the instrument
and examined it carefully.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp52" id="p082_2" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p082.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">“I WISH I WERE GOING WITH YOU”</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“A very good one,” he said, approvingly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
“Too bad the boat isn’t steady enough for us
to take an observation.”</p>

<p>“Why not go ashore?” asked Fred, eagerly.</p>

<p>Redfern glanced at the others, and they
nodded.</p>

<p>“A great idea,” said Bob; “though it
isn’t a very good night.”</p>

<p>“We can get flying glimpses between the
flying clouds,” grinned Tom. “Come ahead.”</p>

<p>The “Gray Gull” was headed for shore.
Jack Lyons took her in as far as he dared;
then the anchor was put over, and the house-boat
came to a rest for the night. The
Palisades, dim and mysterious, loomed high
above them. From the shore came the musical
sighing of the trees, and faint rustlings,
as the underbrush was swayed by the gentle
breeze. To the boys, it sounded very much
like footsteps going and coming; and more
than one felt rather creepy sensations steal
through him.</p>

<p>Jack, Norman Redfern and Joe Preston
jumped into the dory and pulled away, with
the other boat in tow.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it dark?” observed Norman.</p>

<p>“Kind o’ spooky,” said Joe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>“And awful gloomy,” chimed in Jack.</p>

<p>Jack landed his passengers; then returned
for the others. As they walked along, the
flashing rays of their lantern flitted over the
shore in a strangely fantastic manner, now
and then dimmed by a flood of pale moonlight.</p>

<p>“Here’s a pretty good tree,” declared Dave
Brandon, at length. “Only wish we’d
brought our telescope stand along. Still,
this lower limb will do as a rest.”</p>

<p>“Yes; that’s the idea,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“Of course,” went on Redfern, “this is a
very poor way to use a telescope; a firm
stand is essential, even for small instruments;
and a moonless night would be much better
for observing the stars. But Luna herself is
such an interesting object that we should be
satisfied. How many of you have seen it?”</p>

<p>“I have,” answered Jack, “at the Harvard
observatory.”</p>

<p>“And we fellows have often studied it
through Dave’s telescope,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Who discovered the moon?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Do get over your silliness,” said Fred,
witheringly. “It’s growing on you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>Jack was allowed first glimpse through the
telescope.</p>

<p>The surface of the moon, with its mountains
and deep black craters and portions here and
there just a shade less brilliant than the rest,
is always an interesting object, and Jack
uttered an exclamation of pleasure as he
placed his eye to the tube.</p>

<p>“What are those funny light streaks near
the bottom?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Do they all seem to radiate from one of
the craters?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jack. “And, my, but don’t
they spread out for a distance, though?”</p>

<p>“Their nature is not perfectly understood,”
explained Redfern. “It is generally believed
that they are in some way connected with
volcanic upheavals, but just exactly what
story they have to tell no one knows.”</p>

<p>“Very strange,” murmured Jack.</p>

<p>“Don’t suppose that even Joe knows all
about it,” remarked Fred Winter.</p>

<p>“Never looked through a telescope—that’s
the reason,” retorted Preston, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Don’t some of those craters look black,
though?” said Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“That’s due to the absence of any atmosphere
on the moon,” commented Norman.
“You know of course that there’s no water or
vegetation to be found on its surface. If you
were there, you would see no soft, hazy effects,
nothing but a brilliant glare, intensely black
shadows and sharp contrasts. Of course,” he
added, “this is the general nature of all lunar
landscapes—it would be modified to a greater
or less degree by circumstances.”</p>

<p>“I had an idea it would be something like
that,” came from Joe.</p>

<p>Fred really seemed to be hurt at such levity,
but he said nothing, and looked at Redfern as
if waiting for him to continue.</p>

<p>“The sky would be black,” went on the
latter, “and the sun brighter than we ever
see it on the earth. Some shadows would
also be absolutely black, because all light is
cut off; others might be faintly illuminated
by the reflection from some mountain wall.”</p>

<p>“And even the parts in sunlight would
show a lot of differences,” said Joe. “I——”</p>

<p>“Go on, Redfern,” said Fred, hastily.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe’s all right. There would be differences,
of course. The varying character of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
the surfaces, some darker than others, would
have an effect; and the angle they presented
to the sun must still further increase or lessen
their brilliancy. All told, however, these
things would hardly be sufficient to do more
than slightly modify the general effect.”</p>

<p>“What’s the name of that crater?” asked
Jack, several minutes later; “I mean the one
with those funny streaks shooting off all
around.”</p>

<p>“Copernicus.”</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Jack, “it certainly looks
great. Keep away, Fred Winter; I haven’t
finished yet.”</p>

<p>“Scrap beginning already,” chuckled Joe.
“Bring Confuse-us ashore, and sic the dog
on him, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Wonder how the moon ever got there?”
put in Aleck Hunt, reflectively.</p>

<p>“Astronomers have various theories,” answered
Redfern, with a smile. “Some contend
that it was thrown off from the earth; while
others think that it was once a part of the sun.”</p>

<p>The telescope was next turned upon the
planet Mars. Norman Redfern spoke quite
like a professor addressing his class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“Mars is now about as near as it ever gets
to be,” he said. “Put it down at about
thirty-five million miles, and you’ll be very
nearly correct. The so-called canals were
discovered by an Italian astronomer named
Schiaparelli.”</p>

<p>“My, but you talk like a book,” said Joe, a
little awed.</p>

<p>“I can’t see those canals,” remarked Aleck,
with his eye to the tube. “Doesn’t look like
anything more than a little round dot.”</p>

<p>“Very likely not,” said Redfern, dryly.
“It requires a powerful telescope. At Flagstaff,
Arizona, the astronomers have made
many photographs of the planet, and on
these the faint lines are distinguishable.”</p>

<p>“Mighty interesting,” murmured Jack.
“Canals, eh? You mean somebody dug
them?”</p>

<p>Redfern smiled. “Well, that’s what is
claimed,” he said. “But I’m bound to say
not all the astronomers believe it, yet. I
can get some books that tell all about it, if
you like.”</p>

<p>“Say, will you?” exclaimed Fred. “I’d
like to know about that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>Jupiter, with its four moons, the boys found
better suited to the power of their telescope.
The disc was large enough to show a faint
dark line crossing it, while the satellites were
strung out all on one side, like a row of tiny
stars.</p>

<p>Of course, Saturn came in for a share of
their attention, and although its rings were
visible as nothing more than an extremely
small oval, they found it decidedly interesting.</p>

<p>Owing to the unfavorable weather conditions,
it took the boys a very long time to
make their observations; and when Bob
Somers looked at his watch, he uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Good gracious—nearly half-past ten!” he
cried.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve passed a fine, profitable evening,”
declared Fred, “and owe Redfern a vote
of thanks.”</p>

<p>“You bet,” chimed in Jack.</p>

<p>The young man smiled.</p>

<p>“I have enjoyed it, too,” he said. “Now,
I must be going; but I’d be mighty glad if
you would pay me a visit before you leave.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
I live close by. It isn’t much of a place—to
be plain, just a wooden shack.”</p>

<p>“Look out for us to-morrow morning,” said
Jack, promptly.</p>

<p>After receiving instructions where to find
him, the boys rowed back to the house-boat,
the clanking oars sounding strangely distinct.</p>

<p>The novelty of their situation at first prevented
several from sleeping; but about midnight
slumber finally overtook them all, and
thus ended their first day on the Hudson.</p>

<p class="ph3">AN EXPLORING TRIP</p>


<p>After breakfast next morning the “Gray
Gull” was run closer inshore. A favorable
spot for anchorage was found, doing away
with the necessity for using the dory. Each
boy was able to leap across to a jutting point.
Then, jolly and enthusiastic, they began to
walk along the shore.</p>

<p>Often they stopped to gaze upward at the
gigantic cliffs, or to admire the masses of rich
green vegetation or broad expanse of river, now
a greenish-gray, for the sun was hidden.</p>

<p>Around a bend they saw a cabin built at
the base of the cliff.</p>

<p>“That must be it,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cried Tom. “Say, fellows, I
like that chap, Redfern.”</p>

<p>“But what a funny idea, living out here,
all alone,” commented Fred.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. I was always going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
do something of the kind, myself,” said Joe,
and the others laughed in such a lively fashion
that it brought the occupant of the cabin
to the door.</p>

<p>“Welcome, boys,” he said, with a smile.
“Come in and make yourselves at home.”</p>

<p>So the boys trooped in, took seats on anything
they could find, and looked about with
interest.</p>

<p>In one corner a bunk was fastened against
the wall. In another, a shelf contained several
books, which Dave and Fred immediately
spied and began to examine. A rude table
and several equally rude stools completed the
furnishings, save for a charcoal drawing which
hung between the windows.</p>

<p>“That’s bully,” said Tom, admiringly.
“Didn’t know anybody but Dave Brandon
could draw so well.”</p>

<p>“I’m acquainted with the artist,” explained
Norman Redfern. “He and his wife are
spending the summer in a bungalow not far
from here.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s a dandy, that’s sure,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, look at these frivolous books,” laughed
Joe Preston, a moment later. “You’ll never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
get Fred Winter away from ’em. Listen!
Here’s Plutarch’s ‘Lives,’ Motley’s ‘Rise and
Fall of the Dutch Republic,’ Gibbons’ ‘History
of Rome,’ and books on Latin and Greek.”</p>

<p>“The kind of literature a tutor ought to
read, I suppose,” said Norman, with a faint
smile.</p>

<p>“Great Scott, have you tooted?” asked Joe.
“Doin’ it now?”</p>

<p>An uncomfortable expression flitted across
the other’s face. He hesitated for a moment,
then, seeing the frank, interested looks on his
visitors’ faces, replied, “No, not just at present—that
is—oh, well, I suppose I might as
well tell you——” then, as if half regretting
his words, he stopped short.</p>

<p>But Joe Preston’s curiosity was aroused.
Joe hated mysteries, or, rather, always liked to
have them explained at once. So he said
“Well?” in such a tone that there was no
getting out of it.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to give you a short history of my
life,” began Redfern, dryly. “Being an orphan,
I had lived most of the time with an
uncle, near Albany. He hadn’t much money,
but he was of the right sort, and saw to it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
that my education was attended to. I was
sent to a large academy near the city. There
was another school not far away, and the
rivalry between the two institutions was
pretty fierce at times—mostly good-natured,
of course. But that hasn’t anything to do
with my story. After I graduated Uncle Ben
passed away, and the little money he left,
divided among numerous relatives, was soon
gone, and yours truly was thrown on his own
resources.</p>

<p>“Well, through the influence of a friend, I
got a position as tutor to the ward of a rich
man who lives at Nyack. This young chap
is very wealthy in his own right, or will be
when he reaches the age of twenty-one. He
has everything that a boy could wish for,
and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course nobody could get along with
a chap like that,” sniffed Joe. “Why, in our
school——”</p>

<p>But Norman smiled.</p>

<p>“George Clayton is a most unmillionaire
boy, if I may use the expression,” he said.
“He always longed to be like others, in fact,
wanted to rough it a bit. George is a bright,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
manly chap. Why, he’d be wild to go on a
trip like yours.”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear it,” observed Joe. “Some
boys wouldn’t have the nerve to brave the
dangers of a wide stream like the Hudson.”</p>

<p>“We got along splendidly together,” continued
Redfern, “and but for an unfortunate
occurrence I should be his tutor still.” Norman
stared reflectively at the floor for a moment;
the light seemed to fade from his eyes,
and, with a half sigh, he added, “But I was
entirely blameless, and—and—well, his guardian
did not view the matter in that light—and—so
he fired me.”</p>

<p>“Humph! And why didn’t this George
What’s-his-Name stand up for you?” demanded
Jack, indignantly.</p>

<p>“He did. But his guardian is one of those
men who, when they get an idea, stick to it.
Unfortunately, I had no proof of my—my—I
mean,” he added hastily, “of my being in the
right. So that is the way my position as a
tutor slipped away from me last spring.”</p>

<p>“Well, by George—no joke intended”—cried
Bob, energetically—“I’d never let a
thing like that drop; you bet I wouldn’t, eh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
fellows? I’d follow it up till I showed this
gentleman where he stood.”</p>

<p>“Wish I had a bit more of that spirit in
me,” sighed Norman, “but the fact is, I’m
not much of a fighter,” he added, with a faint
smile. “The odds were against me, and I got
discouraged.”</p>

<p>“And what are you doing here?” asked
Joe, bluntly.</p>

<p>“Well, one of my old school chums once
spent a summer in this old shack. He told
me about it—no rent to pay, you know. I’m
going to look for a job in New York pretty
soon, and hope to make out until then.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you feel awful lonely?”</p>

<p>“My books are company, and I get a good
opportunity to study and write.”</p>

<p>“Say,” remarked Jack, “we’ll pass right by
this George Clayton’s town, won’t we?”</p>

<p>“Surest thing I know of,” answered Joe.</p>

<p>“Then why not join our crowd, Redfern?”
said Jack, in his usual free and easy manner,
“and go and see Mr. Guardian again, eh, fellows?”</p>

<p>He glanced inquiringly toward his companions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“Just the scheme,” agreed Bob, warmly.</p>

<p>“Very kind of you chaps to make such an
offer,” said Norman, hesitatingly, “but——”</p>

<p>“Don’t let there be any ‘buts’ about it,”
urged Jack. “Unless you fight the thing,
Mr. Guardian will always say you are in the
wrong. That’s plain, eh, Bob? It might do
you a whole lot of harm.”</p>

<p>“Of course it might,” chimed in Tom.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you have confidence in me,”
said Norman, pleased at their earnestness,
“and I can assure you it is not misplaced.
That affair broke me all up.”</p>

<p>“When did you see the guardian chap
last?” inquired Joe, with a directness that almost
made his chums smile.</p>

<p>“Several months ago.”</p>

<p>“Plenty of time for him to have changed
his opinion. Was the millionaire boy mixed
up in the row?” asked Dave.</p>

<p>“No, it did not concern him in the least.”</p>

<p>“Honest—don’t you think you gave up a
bit too soon, though?” said Jack. “Come
along with us as far as Nyack, tackle Mr.
Guardian again, and our crowd will have a
chance to meet the millionaire boy. I’m awfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
curious to see what kind of a chap he is.
It will kind o’ give variety to the trip. What
do you say?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how I can resist such an invitation,”
laughed Norman, his face lighting
up with pleasure. “You have given me hope,
boys. I guess you are right—I got discouraged
too soon. I hate quarrels, and Colonel
Ellison is a hard man to deal with; but it
won’t do any harm to see him again.”</p>

<p>Bob Somers, who had taken a great fancy
to the quiet, studious-looking young fellow,
was delighted.</p>

<p>“That’s the idea,” he cried, “eh, fellows?”
and a chorus of assenting voices came from
his chums.</p>

<p>“And now that it’s all settled,” remarked
Fred, as he slowly turned the pages of a history,
“would you mind taking a couple of
these books along? This is a dandy—tells
all about Peter the Great; and there’s another
about Mars, by a chap named Lowell,
and——”</p>

<p>But Joe interrupted him with a loud burst
of laughter, whereupon Fred told him just
what he thought of such conduct, and of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
dreadful risk he ran of growing up to be a
perfect ignoramus, all of which Joe listened
to with many smiles and chuckles.</p>

<p>After sitting around for a quarter of an
hour, Jack proposed climbing the Palisades,
and this being agreeable to all, the five soon
started out.</p>

<p>Viewed at close range, the cliffs loomed up
grim and gigantic, the fringe of trees lining
the top appearing like a row of bushes. The
base of the Palisades is almost everywhere
broken into a slope formed by the débris that
has fallen from the cliffs, and in places this
extends upward for hundreds of feet, reaching
to the very summit. Norman Redfern declared
that he would soon pilot them to a place
where the climb to the top would be easy.</p>

<p>The slope along which they made their way
was thickly wooded in parts, and the rich
green foliage and cool, refreshing shadows
pierced by the shafts of sunlight presented a
delightful picture. Close by was the ruin of
a mill. A few crumbling walls and a rusted
fly-wheel alone remained to tell of its existence.
A melancholy stillness seemed to hover
about it, as if to draw a contrast between its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
present condition and that of its busy past,
and the boys, scrambling over the cracked and
broken walls, speculated with interest as to
the causes which had brought about so wonderful
a change.</p>

<p>A startled hare leaped quickly over a pile
of bricks and was soon lost to view amidst the
underbrush.</p>

<p>“If we only had a pop gun, we could have
popped him,” said Jack.</p>

<p>Wandering in and out, now close to the
river, then near the cliffs, Redfern finally
pointed out a path which zigzagged its way
upward. But the active lads were not long
content with this easy way of climbing and
took advantage of any short cut that presented
itself. Some of these were very steep,
and often they slipped and slid and only saved
themselves by clutching tightly to the tangled
grasses and bushes. Showers of stones and
earth occasionally rattled downward, and Joe
distinguished himself by falling flat in a deep
cut formed by the rains and still wet and soggy.</p>

<p>Every foot of the climb so far was through
a charming little wood, composed mainly of
small trees, and all aglow with sunlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>Panting from their exertions, they were
often compelled to rest.</p>

<p>“Look!” exclaimed Jack, presently, pointing
downward.</p>

<p>There, far below them, was the “Gray Gull.”
The breeze had straightened out the bunting
and it fluttered gracefully at the end of the
pole. It was their boat—their home for
the time being, and all surveyed it with a
sense of pride and pleasure.</p>

<p>The further they climbed, the more often
they had to wait for Norman. His strength
was not equal to theirs, and, at length, he was
obliged to follow the beaten trail. All the
boys were surprised at the length of the
climb, for they were at one of the highest
parts of the Palisades.</p>

<p>But the top was finally reached, and, with
aching limbs and panting breath, they threw
themselves amidst some tall grasses to rest.</p>

<p>“What a dandy view!” cried Jack, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>From the heights a magnificent panorama
opened out before them. The great Hudson
reflected the gray, somber clouds, and the
hills beyond melted into the haze of distance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
It was all vast and impressive. The sound of
a motor boat, a mere speck, four hundred feet
below them, reached their ears with singular
clearness.</p>

<p>“You now have a good view of one of
the most famous rivers in the world,” said
Norman.</p>

<p>For a long time they gazed, and it is safe
to say that there was not much that escaped
their attention.</p>

<p>Finally Jack arose.</p>

<p>“Come ahead, fellows,” he said. “We’ll
have to explore a bit.”</p>

<p>Through patches of woods and across rocky
ledges they made their way, sometimes keeping
close to the edge of the cliff and stopping
to look down the precipice. How far below
it seemed to the narrow strip of beach! As
they looked, a solitary bird winged its way
across, its harsh cries gradually growing
fainter and fainter in the distance.</p>

<p>Norman Redfern’s nerves were not equal to
the task imposed by a near approach to the
brink. He admired the courage of the active
lads, though cautioning them to be careful.
But danger only lent spice to the situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t worry about us,” said Jack. “It’s
easy to see the dangerous places; and we
know that the shortest route down isn’t the
best.”</p>

<p>After a time, the party found their progress
along the edge of the cliff barred by a wide,
deep gully extending inward. The slopes
were broken and irregular, full of rocky
ledges, tangled masses of vegetation and trees.
A small stream of water could be seen trickling
down the center.</p>

<p>“Here’s where we have a chance to do
some tall climbing,” said Aleck Hunt. “Going
to be a rough job, too.”</p>

<p>“Better let it be a case of walking around,”
advised Norman Redfern.</p>

<p>“Looks as if it would mean a quarter of a
mile tramp,” objected Joe Preston. “If I see
an easy place, I’m going to beat all hands to
the top of the cliff on the other side.”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Jack. “If I knew
how to climb and be on the level at the same
time, I’d accept your challenge. Guess I’ll
walk around.”</p>

<p>This apparently settled the matter, and all
five started off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>Sometimes, with loud yells, the boys chased
bright-colored butterflies—that is, all but Dave
and Fred. Their interest was centered on the
plants and flowers which grew so abundantly
about them.</p>

<p>Joe Preston, who had stopped several times
at the brink of the gully, finally went on
ahead.</p>

<p>“Hello!” cried Bob, presently. “What in
the dickens has become of Joe?”</p>

<p>“Gee Whitaker, where in the world did he
get to?” chimed in Aleck.</p>

<p>“I saw him standing by that rock,” said
Redfern. “It was only a moment ago.”</p>

<p>Around them was an open stretch, with
nothing to hide the view, but Joe Preston was
nowhere in sight.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">JOE IN TROUBLE</p>


<p>“That’s the strangest thing I ever heard
of,” cried Jack, excitedly. “Don’t believe Joe
would have given us the slip.”</p>

<p>They walked to the edge of the gully and
looked up and down.</p>

<p>“Hello, Joe, whoop la, hi, hi!”</p>

<p>But no response followed the sound of his
voice.</p>

<p>“Jiminy, I don’t understand that!” gasped
Aleck.</p>

<p>“What can have become of him?” said
Norman, apprehensively, and he raised his
voice with the others in a series of tremendous
shouts.</p>

<p>Still there was no response.</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows,” shouted Bob. “Sure
as guns, something must have happened.”</p>

<p>He dashed ahead, with the others following
closely at his heels, all a prey to the most
dreadful forebodings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>Far ahead were two figures, but no others
were within range of their vision.</p>

<p>Panting and excited, Jack Lyons and Bob
Somers kept well in the lead, and so the mad
race was continued, until they had nearly
reached the spot where Joe was last seen.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bob, who was plunging through
a mass of tangled weeds and grasses, gave a
yell which sent a thrill of terror through his
companions’ hearts. They saw him fall forward
and wildly clutch a straggling bush.</p>

<p>“Look out!” he gasped. “Look out!”</p>

<p>The warning cry came just in time.
Stretching straight across their path was a
gaping, V-shaped cleft almost hidden from
view by vegetation.</p>

<p>With faces drawn and pale, they gathered
at the edge and looked below. Bob Somers,
scarcely realizing how he had managed to
save himself, was still the foremost.</p>

<p>A thrill of horror shot through them.
There, caught on a projecting ledge about
fifteen feet below, lay the motionless form of
Joe Preston, and still below him was a terrifying,
almost vertical drop to the deepest portion
of the ravine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“Great Scott!” gasped Bob. Then: “Joe,
Joe!” he called. “Joe! Speak—are you
badly hurt?”</p>

<p>A moment of dreadful suspense followed.</p>

<p>Joe slowly stirred and passed his hand
across his forehead.</p>

<p>“Joe, look out—don’t move an inch!”</p>

<p>Bob spoke with thrilling intensity, and Joe
Preston’s awakening faculties began to grasp
the peril of his situation. He huddled close
to the smooth, rocky wall and shut his eyes
to hide the depths below.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, Joe?” inquired Norman
Redfern, breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Must have hit my head an awful crack,”
answered the boy, weakly. “I was chasing
a butterfly, and all of a sudden felt myself
going down—it was awful.”</p>

<p>“No bones broken, I hope?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, but I’ve got a terrible
pain in my head.”</p>

<p>“You had a mighty close call, Joe. But
for that ledge——”</p>

<p>Norman glanced gravely at his companions,
and they nodded.</p>

<p>“Whew! Makes me shiver to think of it,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
breathed Bob, with a shrug of his broad
shoulders.</p>

<p>Then they began to discuss the means of
bringing Joe to the top.</p>

<p>“If we only had a rope,” sighed Aleck
Hunt.</p>

<p>“But we haven’t,” said Jack, “and there’s
no use talking about it.”</p>

<p>“Then what can we do?”</p>

<p>“Form a human chain. Our crowd is big
enough. Beside, those two men coming along
will most likely give us a hand. Feeling
better, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Yes! But, for goodness’ sake, fellows,
hurry up. This ledge seems awfully small,
and my head is dizzy.”</p>

<p>“Courage, Joe, old boy, we’ll have you up
in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>By this time the two men were close at
hand, and divining that something was amiss,
hurried forward. One was rather tall, with
sandy hair and a pointed beard, while the
other, shorter and not quite so stout, had intensely
black hair and mustache.</p>

<p>“Hello, what’s this?” exclaimed the former.
Then, as his eyes rested on the dangerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
cleft and Joe Preston on the ledge, he
gave a low whistle of astonishment.</p>

<p>“H’m, your friend’s in trouble, sure enough.
How did it happen?”</p>

<p>Jack briefly explained.</p>

<p>“Certainly we’ll help you—no doubt about
that. But can you stand it down there for
about a second, my boy?”</p>

<p>He hastily unstrung a small camera, sighted
it, a click sounded, and Joe had been snapped.</p>

<p>“Ought to make a remarkable picture,”
observed the man. “Now to work.”</p>

<p>A difficult and dangerous task was before
the boys, but none faltered. Bob’s lips were
drawn tightly together.</p>

<p>“I’ll go first,” he announced, briefly. “My
muscles are pretty strong. Ready! Grab
my legs, Jack, and hold on tight.”</p>

<p>Without another word, Bob threw himself
flat and worked his way slowly over to the
edge. Jack hung to him with all his
strength, and he, in turn, was held tightly
by another. And thus the dangling human
chain hung downward, and Bob’s waving
arms approached the helpless prisoner.</p>

<p>Three feet—two feet—one foot—for an instant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
Bob closed his eyes. When he opened
them again, Joe Preston was within reach.</p>

<p>“Quick, Joe,” he gasped. “Quick!”</p>

<p>But as Joe slowly raised himself to an upright
position, he found that his strength was
practically gone.</p>

<p>“I could never hold on, Bob,” he said,
“never!”</p>

<p>“Don’t have to. Give me your wrists.”</p>

<p>Bob Somers’ sinewy hands closed around
them with a grip that could not fail.</p>

<p>“Pull up, fellows,” he yelled.</p>

<p>The tug began. Their knowledge of the
danger seemed to give them double strength.
Straining every muscle, never daring to pause
for an instant, the boys and men worked
silently, while white-faced Joe Preston swung
over the chasm.</p>

<p>Jack Lyons felt himself being dragged to
safety. His face was purple; his joints seemed
to fairly crack, but, with a determination that
increased as the moments slipped by, he held
on.</p>

<p>How long it seemed! But finally the
burden was taken from him by willing
hands, and exhausted Jack Lyons lay back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
on the turf. Then Bob Somers was drawn
slowly over the edge, and, at length, other
hands seized Joe Preston’s wrists. One final
tug, and the boy was safe.</p>

<p>For several moments, not a word was
spoken. Joy and an intense feeling of relief
filled their hearts, making them forget
aching bones and sore flesh.</p>

<p>Then Joe spoke up.</p>

<p>“I’ll never forget this, fellows,” he said
quietly, “never!”</p>

<p>“And I guess none of the rest will, either,”
observed one of the strangers, dryly. “It
was a narrow shave, my lad. How do you
feel—hurt yourself much?”</p>

<p>“A bit bruised, and my head aches; that’s
all. That ledge seems to have been put there
for my especial benefit, eh, Jack?” and Joe
smiled rather weakly.</p>

<p>The boys thanked the strangers heartily
for their assistance. Norman Redfern was
interested when he learned that the two were
on their way to visit his artist friend.</p>

<p>“Yes, we three,” the man indicated his
dark-haired companion, “knew each other
in Paris. I’m from the South, spending a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
month or two here, and want to renew old
friendships.”</p>

<p>“You are artists, then?” inquired Redfern.</p>

<p>The others nodded.</p>

<p>“But sometimes I amuse myself with the
camera,” said one.</p>

<p>“Say—you ought to take one of our house-boat,”
put in Joe, eagerly. “That will make
up for the picture you got of me.”</p>

<p>“House-boat?”</p>

<p>Then explanations followed, and before
they parted the strangers promised to visit
the “Gray Gull” that afternoon.</p>

<p>Joe Preston had been pretty badly shaken
up, and, as his head still ached, it was decided
to return.</p>

<p>“Makes me feel like a number one dunce,
too,” he remarked, sheepishly. “Guess maybe
I deserved it for chasing butterflies. Isn’t
that so, Redfern?”</p>

<p>“Well, hardly,” responded the ex-tutor.
“I was glad to note that none of you made
any effort to wantonly hurt the little creatures.
That I would consider indefensible;
though some boys are inclined to be thoughtless
about such matters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>“Never saw such a trap in my life,” said
Bob. “Who would ever expect to find such
a place, all overgrown with weeds?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you fellows can’t excuse yourselves
that way,” said Fred Winter, with a rather
forced laugh. “If the crowd stood in need
of a frightful scare we got it, all right.”</p>

<p>“You seem to be taking the lesson to
heart,” said Norman Redfern. “That is the
best course. I never was more thankful in
my life. If this place had been like one I
know of a few miles from here, nothing could
have saved you, Joe.”</p>

<p>“What is it like?” faltered the boy.</p>

<p>“A narrow, half-hidden cleft running in
from the face of the Palisades. There is a
clear drop of several hundred feet.”</p>

<p>The boys felt a shiver run through them.</p>

<p>“That shows how well it is to be careful,”
added Redfern.</p>

<p>By easy stages they covered the distance
back to the zigzag road; and upon reaching
Redfern’s shack Joe was able to assure them
all that he felt much better.</p>

<p>“Ready to leave with us to-morrow morning,
eh, Norman?” inquired Jack, presently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>“But won’t it crowd you too much?”</p>

<p>“Not at all; there’s room for two or three
more—six the diameter of Tom.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I have no very particular engagements
to keep me. I’ll be glad of a change—was
getting kind of rusty.”</p>

<p>“I declare, I most forgot poor young Confuse-us,”
remarked Jack. “He must be a bit
hungry by this time. Who wants to go over
to the boat?”</p>

<p>“Guess I will,” answered Fred, closing the
book.</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” put in Joe.</p>

<p>Then the others decided to join.</p>

<p>So off they started, in lively spirits again,
for Joe declared that he now felt no worse
than if he had just come out of an ordinary
football scrimmage.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” said Aleck, suddenly, “I never
finished that story I was going to tell you.
Listen—it’s a bully one.”</p>

<p>“Get it off your mind—do,” snickered Joe.</p>

<p>“I’m going to. Well, it’s about Joe
Archer, who played short-stop on our team.
He was down on Battery Park the other day,
when——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>“Thunderation!” broke in Bob, suddenly.
“Look at that, fellows!”</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see——”</p>

<p>And Joe saw. Two figures were reclining
in indolent ease on the deck of the house-boat,
and the first glance showed the boys that they
were unprepossessing specimens of humanity.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE BATTLE FOR THE BOAT</p>


<p>“Tramps, as I live!” cried Jack, excitedly.
“Did you ever hear of such nerve!”</p>

<p>“The worst ever!” exclaimed Tom. “We
ought to rout them out of that pretty fast.”</p>

<p>“And we will, too,” said Bob. “Come
ahead, fellows,” and he broke into a run.</p>

<p>“Hold on,” said Fred, solemnly. “Diplomacy
is a good word.”</p>

<p>But the others did not seem to hear.</p>

<p>As they crashed through the underbrush,
then swooped pell-mell across an open space,
the men arose, with ludicrous haste, and were
about to leap ashore, when the larger laid
a restraining hand upon his companion’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s nothing but a parcel of boys,”
he said. “Don’t disturb yourself, pal; let’s
continue our peaceful meal.”</p>

<p>He laughed, and sank back against the side
of the boat, and calmly surveyed the indignant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
boys, who arrived on the scene quite out of
breath.</p>

<p>They were both large men, ragged and
unkempt in appearance—typical specimens
of their kind; although the one who had
spoken wore a very mild expression for a
tramp.</p>

<p>“I say,” began Jack, impetuously, “can’t
you chaps find some other place to eat your
grub?—and—by Jingo, I’ll bet it’s our grub,
too.”</p>

<p>He stared at the open window, then at
several familiar pots and pans which rested
beside the grinning tramps.</p>

<p>“Well, I like that. I—I——”</p>

<p>“We thought you would. That’s why we
done it, pal,” said number one, eating a large
slice of broiled ham, with evident relish.
“Are you the head duffer, might I ask—but
surely you ain’t running this here craft yourselves?”</p>

<p>“You’d better get out!” cried Jack, fiercely,
despite the efforts of Fred Winter to resort to
diplomatic measures.</p>

<p>“Nuttin’ annoys me pal s’much as when
he’s disturbed at eatin’, eh, Duke?” and, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
number one nodded and helped himself to
another supply, the speaker waved his arm
threateningly.</p>

<p>“Scat, scatter, an’ fade away; likewise, depart,”
he said. “Drift, skip and begone.
What d’ye think, Duke, of a lot of youngsters
like them bein’ so fur away from their
own little firesides?”</p>

<p>“I think,” remarked the other, “that briled
ham and potatoes, as a staple article of food,
can’t be beat. Some gingerbread, Count; and
if you don’t mind, I’ll top off with some
crackers and cheese.”</p>

<p>“So be it, Duke. If you see anything you
don’t want, ask for it. My good breeding
won’t rub off—wilderness an’ parlor life, it’s
all the same. Sardines? Certainly, Duke;
but them mostly comes at the beginning of repasts.
Tote away there, you on shore; it ain’t
perlite ter stare at people eatin’.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t think you’re so funny!”
cried Jack Lyons, indignantly. “I’ll have
the constable after you quicker than a wink,
if you don’t skip.”</p>

<p>“The dearest friend I have; he’s cost me
many a dollar. Don’t hurry yerself, Duke.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“I say, my man,” said Fred Winter, in a
soft voice, determined to show his chums the
beneficial effects of diplomacy, “come now,
get out quietly, like good fellows. We don’t
want any trouble, and won’t make any fuss
about all that grub you—you—swiped.”</p>

<p>“Listen to birdie chirping. Methinks that
butter in summer ain’t no softer than him,
eh, Duke?”</p>

<p>“A dub,” said tramp number one, squinting
at Fred Winter. “His phiz shows it.”</p>

<p>“Needs a good beatin’ ter put some spunk
in him,” added number two.</p>

<p>Both howled with laughter, while Fred,
much disgusted and red in the face, forgot, in
the wave of indignation that swept through
him, all about diplomacy.</p>

<p>“I’m only going to tell you fellows once
more,” warned Jack. “Better get out, or
you’ll meet your dearest friend arm to arm.”</p>

<p>“Well, Duke, did yez hear that? There’s
a real live humorist fur ye—‘Arm ter arm.’
More gingerbread? Certainly, Duke. Floatin’
groceries in their wilderness is a wrinkle of
the twentieth century wot don’t harm no
one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>The boys looked up and down the river and
at the motor boats passing. But no one was
in sight on the shore and the boats were too
far out. There seemed to be no help at hand
and, in vexation and disgust, they withdrew
to talk the matter over.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to get those fellows off in a
hurry,” said Bob, determinedly.</p>

<p>“What in thunder can we do?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p>“Go right on board, and pitch into them,”
suggested Joe, doubling his fists and making
about four savage passes in the air. “Fire
’em off, bag and baggage.”</p>

<p>But Fred hastily shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, no!” he demurred. “Besides, they’re
much too hefty. Maybe Redfern could help
us.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” mused Jack. “He’s a
jolly nice chap—but doesn’t look quite old
enough to scare ’em.”</p>

<p>“We mustn’t allow ourselves to get excited,”
drawled Dave.</p>

<p>“But those fellows can’t be allowed to stay
on the ‘Gray Gull’ all afternoon,” protested
Joe. “I’m beginning to boil over. I’ll bet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
they get away with most of our grub, too.
And who knows but what they may have assassinated
poor Confuse-us.”</p>

<p>“What? You don’t think that—that—they——”
began Fred, aghast.</p>

<p>“Not on purpose, perhaps. But if they
stepped on him, in some dark corner—well,
Confuse-us hasn’t a constitution which could
stand that.”</p>

<p>“Well, it certainly makes us look like a
lot of softies,” declared Joe, walking slowly
toward the water’s edge. “Look at the grinning
chump waving his hand. Hello—this
is good stuff.”</p>

<p>Joe stooped over, and gathered up a handful
of mud, and, almost before his companions
could divine his intentions, the boy’s
arm swung around and a nice, compact mud-ball
was spinning swiftly through the air.</p>

<p>The distance was not very great, and the
throw unfortunately successful.</p>

<p>The “Count,” with his back turned, was
just on the point of arising, when the missile
thudded against him. Being partly off
his balance and taken entirely by surprise,
he gave a yell, and finding himself going forward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
miscalculated the amount of energy
necessary to regain his former position.</p>

<p>The result was startling. He could not
save himself, and, with surprising suddenness,
lurched over the side of the boat.</p>

<p>A great splash went up, and the astounded
“Duke” received a generous shower bath.</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar!” gasped Jack.</p>

<p>“Thunderation!” cried the author of the
mischief, almost as much astonished as the
unfortunate “Count.”</p>

<p>The latter completely disappeared for an
instant, and when his bushy head came in
sight above the surface, gone was the humorous
twinkle in his eye, gone was the smile
which had curved his lips.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz, this is no place for us,” murmured
Joe. “He looks peevish—perhaps he
dislikes water.”</p>

<p>“It’s had a frightful effect on him, anyhow,”
laughed Dave.</p>

<p>“Whew!” sputtered the “Count.” “I’ve
swallowed a gallon of the saltest water that
man ever tasted. Who throw’d it, Bobby?”</p>

<p>“That little fat one.”</p>

<p>“Ketch ’im, then!” roared the “Count,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
wading toward the bank with an energy
that indicated trouble ahead. “Quick now,
Bobby. Jist let me git a hold of ’im. Quick!
He’s goin’ ter rue the day he left his own
little fireside.”</p>

<p>And the “Duke,” heeding the lusty voice
of his companion, leaped ashore and made directly
toward the group.</p>

<p>But they resolutely held their ground.</p>

<p>Jack Lyons’ eyes began to flash. The
fellows who had played against him at football
knew the look that was in his eyes now.</p>

<p>“Keep back, ‘Duke,’” he said, quietly, “or
you’ll get mixed up in a good deal of a row.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’d better!” said Bob Somers,
quietly, and, as the tramp showed no intention
of heeding this well-meant advice, seven
pairs of hands reached down, for even Fred
was aroused, and seven mud-balls were hastily
formed.</p>

<p>Then Jack spoke up again:</p>

<p>“Did you hear?”</p>

<p>“I hear’d,” snarled the “Duke.” “We ain’t
a-goin’ to do a thing to you. Wait till——”</p>

<p>“One—two—three!” Jack’s voice interrupted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>The “Duke,” urged by his companion, who
had just scrambled ashore, broke into a run.</p>

<p>Then Jack nodded to his chums.</p>

<p>“Let him have it,” he said, still quietly.</p>

<p>Seven arms drew back, and seven missiles
shot through the air.</p>

<p>The tramp let out a yell and stopped short,
for most of the mud-balls had landed
squarely. Then, furious with rage, he made
a headlong dash toward them.</p>

<p>But again the arms swung around with perfect
precision.</p>

<p>Swish, splash—the mud was just the proper
consistency for mud-balls. It splattered all
over the unfortunate tramp number one, and
stung him until he could no longer face the
bombardment.</p>

<p>Unmindful of the yells and fierce commands
of number two, he ignominiously
turned his back and fled before the storm.</p>

<p>The “Count,” a sadly bedraggled and dripping
object, witnessed the rout with unconcealed
feelings of disgust. Slowly he walked
to where his companion had halted. The
boys were then treated to a volley of violent
threats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>All the ugliness in the natures of the men
was aroused, and, determining upon revenge,
they picked up whatever missiles lay within
reach and began a fierce onslaught.</p>

<p>Sticks, stones and lumps of hard earth
whizzed and rattled around the boys.</p>

<p>Before such a dangerous hail, the lads were
compelled to retreat. Joe uttered a yell, and
began limping around on one foot; Fred
Winter dropped his glasses.</p>

<p>The tramps, with shouts of triumph, continued
to lumber forward, promising the boys
that when they had finished with them their
house-boat would be wrecked.</p>

<p>And just then, when things looked a bit
discouraging, the sound of hurrying feet came
to their ears. Three men dashed forward,
and the boys instantly recognized two of them
as the artists whom they had met on the top
of the Palisades.</p>

<p>The man with the sandy beard was well in
advance, and had his camera pointed.</p>

<p>Click!—the scene of battle was snapped.</p>

<p>The “Count” and “Duke” turned abruptly
at the sight and began to flee.</p>

<p>Perhaps neither had ever before sprinted in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
a livelier fashion, and in a moment their
forms were lost to view behind the intervening
trees.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! They ought to enter for the
next marathon,” gasped Jack. “Mighty
lucky you happened along.”</p>

<p>“Well, boys, you’re having what might be
styled a fierce day. We seem to have frightened
those tramps pretty badly; perhaps
they thought this camera was a new sort of a
blunderbuss.”</p>

<p>“Big scrap?” inquired the dark-haired
artist.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; you see it was this way,” and
Jack soon acquainted their rescuers with all
the facts.</p>

<p>“I declare,” remarked the sandy-bearded
artist, with a smile, “if I stick by you boys a
little longer, I’ll get some remarkable snapshots.
By the way, this is the artist friend I
was telling you about.”</p>

<p>The boys nodded, and surveyed Norman
Redfern’s friend with interest. He was a
clear-cut, smooth-faced and solidly built
young fellow of about twenty-five.</p>

<p>Anxious to see if any damage had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
done, the boys lost no time in boarding the
“Gray Gull.” Confuse-us greeted them with
wagging tail and plaintive cries, but his constitution
did not seem to have suffered.</p>

<p>“They’ve eaten about four days’ grub;
that’s what they’ve done,” remarked Jack,
indignantly.</p>

<p>“Lucky they didn’t take your painting
along, Jack,” said Joe.</p>

<p>But Jack’s suspicious glances rested on a
guileless, innocent face.</p>

<p>Fred presently slipped off, and they saw
him hovering like a shadow around the spot
where he had lost his glasses. He returned
shortly, bearing them in triumph.</p>

<p>The visitors were much interested in the
house-boat. Redfern soon after joined them
and, of course, heard all about the latest adventure.</p>

<p>They passed a jolly afternoon. The artists
talked entertainingly of their experiences
abroad; about roughing-it trips through
France, Switzerland and Italy; of climbing
Vesuvius and sleeping on the cliffs at Capri;
of ancient Pompeii, and the historic ruins in
Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>“Dandy chaps,” remarked Jack, when they
had gone.</p>

<p>“Aren’t they, just?” said Tom. “Did us
a good turn, too.”</p>

<p>“Awful easy life, being an artist,” quoth
Aleck. “All they have to do is to sit down
and paint pictures; then people come along
and say, ‘That’s bully—swell—out of sight,’
eh, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Some of ’em starve in garrets, though;
I’ve read about it.”</p>

<p>“It’s because they’re not good artists, then,”
said Aleck, with an air of superior wisdom.</p>

<p>“Now, you chaps,” remarked Jack, “I
move that we get out in the stream a bit.
Those tramps may take it into their heads to
come back and throw a few rocks.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Joe. “Up anchor,
jolly tars.”</p>

<p>The “Gray Gull” soon drew away from
the shore and was brought to a stop at a safe
distance. The weather was dull and gloomy,
and the opposite hills were almost swallowed
up in the heavy atmosphere.</p>

<p>By and by Jack lighted the red and green
lanterns, and, feeling secure and content, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
retired within the cozy interior and had their
supper in peace and comfort.</p>

<p>Finally Aleck opened the door and stepped
out upon the deck.</p>

<p>“Say, fellows!” he called, “we’re up in
the air.”</p>

<p>“You are, maybe,” grinned Joe.</p>

<p>“No—honest, the anchor must have pulled
loose, and we’ve floated off. Makes me dizzy.
Who knows but what we’re a mile high by
this time?”</p>

<p>“Oh, come down,” laughed Dave.</p>

<p>“Well, look and see.”</p>

<p>As the boys joined Aleck outside, each
uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“If this fog were any thicker, it would be
solid,” said Jack, solemnly.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">A COLLISION</p>


<p>It did seem indeed as though the house-boat
were suspended in space. The lanterns
threw a strange, weird light on the swirling
mist which swept slowly by. The unseen
water lapped and gurgled against the sides of
the “Gray Gull.”</p>

<p>Far out, the long, hoarse blast of a fog-horn
told of a passing boat groping its way
along; then came a response, fainter, like an
echo from the distance. The damp air brought
with it other sounds, too; the sharp, imperious
whistle of a tug nearer at hand, and the steady,
rhythmic clanking of its machinery.</p>

<p>A strange sensation as of drifting came
over the boys, and but for the fact that Jack
tested the anchor, all would have believed
they were floating further out on the river.</p>

<p>When Aleck Hunt appeared with a lantern,
a chorus of oh’s and ah’s escaped their lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>None had ever seen such a weird and startling
effect before.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” cried Jack.</p>

<p>As Aleck slowly swung his lantern from
side to side, a crowd of shadowy giants hovered
menacingly above them. Each movement
sent them springing about, to dance and
flitter on the restless, eddying vapor.</p>

<p>As arms uplifted, great images with giant
bands waved threateningly, and then flashed
downward, as if to pluck them up and disperse
them through the whitish haze.</p>

<p>Suddenly the grim shadows blended into
one; then, with startling rapidity, the swinging
lantern threw fantastic blots and blurs
and queer-shaped patches of light on the
moving curtain.</p>

<p>“Oh, but it’s strange,” remarked Joe, in
awesome tones. “Wish we were a bit nearer
the shore. Kind o’ ghostly, eh?”</p>

<p>“Creepy enough, I should say so.”</p>

<p>“Makes a fellow’s head dizzy.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott, that boat must be awfully
near,—’most on top of us.”</p>

<p>The sharp, warning notes of its whistle,
again sounding, seemed to burst forth from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
a point close at hand. The pounding of the
engine, the labored exhaust all told of its
approach, and seven figures, with a sudden
flush of excitement, crowded to the edge of the
deck, and vainly tried to pierce the gloom.</p>

<p>“Can’t see a thing,” muttered Aleck.</p>

<p>“Great Scott, look out!”</p>

<p>A series of frantic yells suddenly went up
from the occupants of the house-boat; then
followed another.</p>

<p>Lights, like great eyes, struggled to show
themselves, and, immediately after, the frightened
boys saw a confused blur of shadowy
masses forging its way toward them. The
swish, as the sharp prow cut through the
water, reached their ears clearly.</p>

<p>There was no time for action; their voices
united in one long cry of alarm.</p>

<p>But it was too late.</p>

<p>A dark mass, cutting the vapor, loomed
high up; the eyes shaped themselves into
lanterns. There was an instant of breathless
suspense.</p>

<p>Then the “Gray Gull” staggered and
groaned, and seemed to fairly rise out of the
water under the force of the impact. A series<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
of terrific bumps, jolts and grinds carried
terror to their hearts, while a hissing, boiling
sheet of angry water rising between the
two craft swept across the deck.</p>

<p>For an instant, it seemed as if the “Gray
Gull” had been struck a mortal blow. Wobbling
violently, she swung around with a
creaking groan and tugged hard on the
anchor chain.</p>

<p>Confused blurs of light and dark, a grim,
black hull, slipped by. Shouts rose, then
grew fainter; the lanterns became eyes again,
and in another instant, all had vanished in
the gray gloom of fog beyond.</p>

<p>For a moment, not a sound escaped the
boys’ lips. Clutching whatever support lay
within reach, they steadied themselves.</p>

<p>Sharp and clear came the clanging signals
from the engine-room of the tug; then the
sound of machinery stopped and a loud voice
hailed them.</p>

<p>“Hello, back there, are you all right?”</p>

<p>“What do you think, Jack?” asked Fred,
in a voice that trembled with excitement.</p>

<p>The first shock of fear had passed; Jack
was calm and collected again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“Still right side up—she hit us a glancing
blow, luckily.” Then, raising his voice, he
yelled, “All right, we don’t need any help.
But you will, if you don’t keep a bit further
out—you’ll break a chunk out of the Palisades!”</p>

<p>A hoarse laugh followed; the whistle
sounded, and the tug was again in motion.</p>

<p>“What’s that—what’s that?” asked Joe,
excitedly.</p>

<p>He had been swinging his lantern close to
the water’s edge, in an effort to find out the
extent of the damage, and detected a small object
floating slowly away. It had a strangely
familiar look.</p>

<p>“By Jingo, Confuse-us overboard!” yelled
Joe.</p>

<p>He leaned far out, and grabbed the dog,
which in another instant would have been
beyond his reach.</p>

<p>Confuse-us’ eyes were shut and Confuse-us’
tail was still.</p>

<p>“Poor little dub,” echoed Aleck, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Quick,” cried Bob. “Bring him in!”</p>

<p>Their own danger was forgotten on the
instant. They gathered around, and set to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
work with all the energy and earnestness that
such a desperate case required, and their
efforts were presently rewarded.</p>

<p>Confuse-us blinked his eyes, and, with returning
consciousness, wagged his stubby tail;
and a loud, long cheer went up, which did a
bit more to bring the pup around.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Jack, with a shrug of his
shoulders, “we had better get nearer the
shore. That was a pretty close shave.”</p>

<p>“Rather!” said Tom. “Whew! I thought
we were going down, sure.”</p>

<p>“If that boat had struck us squarely,”
added Dave, “it would have been——”</p>

<p>“A case of swim,” put in Jack. “Plenty
of excitement for one day, eh?”</p>

<p>“A bit too much,” said Joe, with a vivid
recollection of his own mishap. “Don’t let
Fred get hold of a book; we might as well
turn in.”</p>

<p>And they did.</p>

<p>Early next morning, Norman Redfern appeared,
bringing with him a few articles
which he especially valued.</p>

<p>“Up anchor—let ’er go!” said Dick, and
the “Gray Gull” resumed her voyage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>The river and its surroundings seemed to
grow more interesting as they progressed.
The great excursion boats plying to Newburgh;
the Albany day line of steamers, and
a host of other craft, from handsome private
yachts and motor boats to lumbering schooners
and clumsier barges from Haverstraw, loaded
with bricks, all came in for a share of attention.
The telescope swept them from stem
to stern and back again, and a running fire
of comments and speculation often resulted.</p>

<p>They, too, were regarded with interest, and
occasionally, when sarcastic hails and laughter
reached their ears, the boys yelled back replies
with all the riotous energy that the
incident warranted.</p>

<p>The great wall of the Palisades, they found,
came to an abrupt end, and some distance
further along rose a thickly wooded hill,
skirting the shore of the river for miles. On
the eastern side Norman Redfern pointed out
Irvington, the home of Washington Irving, and
then Tarrytown and the historic Dobbs’ ferry.</p>

<p>The river soon widened out into the Tappan
Sea, and the opposite shore could be seen but
faintly through a gray-blue haze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>Saucy little waves reflected the clear blue
overhead. The day promised to be hot, and
white clouds piling up in the west began to
assume an ominous appearance.</p>

<p>“Nyack the next stop, captain?” asked
Joe.</p>

<p>“Right you are.”</p>

<p>“Then for the millionaire boy,” grinned
Aleck.</p>

<p>Norman Redfern became grave and thoughtful.
No doubt his rather timid nature shrank
from the interview which only the house-boat
boys’ urging had induced him to seek. The
disastrous end of his first engagement as a
tutor, the subsequent loss of another post
upon which he had set his heart and the discouraging
search for a position, all served to
increase his tendency to shrink from the hard
knocks which the world sometimes deals out.
Self-effacing, and with an almost over-developed
sense for the rights of others, the
game of life was a much more serious matter
to him than to one like the lively, courageous
Bob Somers.</p>

<p>Colonel Ellison, George Clayton’s guardian,
had none of these traits. He was a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
man, with a big voice; aggressive, strictly
honest, stubborn—one of that type who rises
superior to any situation, and who has very
little sense of the rights of others.</p>

<p>So Norman’s heart misgave him; but his
lively companions served to encourage and
cheer him, and keep alive his reawakened
determination to assert his rights.</p>

<p>“Jolly curious to meet the millionaire boy,”
remarked Jack. “Hope he won’t be too stuck
up to notice us in this rig. We don’t look
any too stylish, you know.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t that kind,” said Norman. “He
is a fine lad; but of course you must remember
one thing.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“His surroundings and life of ease and
luxury have formed certain characteristics
which are only to be expected. Perhaps, if
you didn’t know him well, he might be considered
a trifle overbearing—a bit set upon
having his own way. But, in the main, his
good traits more than counterbalance it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he’s a silly chump, after all,” Joe
whispered to Bob, a moment later, as they
stood on the deck. “Norman’s an easy, good-natured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
chap, and would like ’most anybody.
Gee whiz, but the river’s wide, eh?”</p>

<p>“It certainly is,” answered Jack. “Looks
more like a bay. Let’s have the tube, Joe.
There’s a train. See it? looks great through
the glass.”</p>

<p>“So it does,” agreed Joe, taking his turn
with the telescope; “and there’s a motor
boat close inshore.”</p>

<p>“We’re coming to Nyack, boys,” said Redfern,
stepping out upon the deck. “Getting
along at racing speed, too—the tide is with
us. In a few minutes you’ll see Colonel Ellison’s
house.”</p>

<p>“Dandy place to live, out here,” said Dave.</p>

<p>“Swell,” agreed Joe. “A chap could have
no end of fun.”</p>

<p>The charming little town of Nyack was
now in full view. Handsome residences extended
along the river for a considerable distance
and many fine trees were outlined
sharply against the white cumulus clouds.</p>

<p>Redfern presently touched Jack Lyons’
arm.</p>

<p>“That house with the big columns in front
is Colonel Ellison’s home,” he said.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE MILLIONAIRE BOY</p>


<p>“And a mighty fine place, too,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Looks like a museum,” added Fred.</p>

<p>“Aren’t the grounds magnificent?” went
on Redfern. “That long line of columns at
the side of the house is a pergola; then there
are statues, and graveled walks, and beautiful
flower beds.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t look like any of the other houses
around,” observed Aleck Hunt.</p>

<p>“No! The Colonel is an enthusiast on all
things pertaining to ancient Greece, and built
his house accordingly. Those of you who
have seen pictures of the Parthenon at Athens
will recognize the style.”</p>

<p>“Fine inside?” asked Fred.</p>

<p>“It is—more than fine. A bit beyond that
wharf, Jack, is a good landing place; water’s
pretty deep, and you can get in close. I
think I’ll spruce up, now, and prepare for the
Colonel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>The “Gray Gull,” at full speed, was turned
shoreward. The trees and houses were reflected
in confused, wriggling patches in the
listless water, as were several white motor
boats, lazily swinging at their moorings.</p>

<p>Captain Jack navigated the craft skilfully,
while Joe, with a piece of lead, kept sounding.
Within easy jumping distance of the
shelving shore they finally came to a stop,
and the anchor rattled overboard.</p>

<p>“Now, what’s the program, Jack?” asked
Aleck.</p>

<p>“We’ll explore a bit, while Norman visits
the Colonel.”</p>

<p>“And if you hear loud calls for help, lend
me a hand,” remarked Norman, with a faint
smile. “The Colonel is a man of a more
certain than uncertain temper, and, like the
Colonel, it rises rapidly and eclipses all competitors.
Well, boys, wish me luck.”</p>

<p>“You bet we do!” cried Jack. “Don’t let
him worry you.”</p>

<p>“Keep your fists flying, first, last and all
the time. Yes—we’ll be along here somewhere,”
added Joe. “Don’t hurry, and do
your best.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>“Wonder what the row was about,” murmured
Aleck, as the slender figure of the
former tutor went along the road.</p>

<p>“Ask me an easy one,” said Joe. “Norman
doesn’t seem to want to talk about it much,
does he? But he’s all right; I’d bet on that.
Maybe the silly millionaire youngster——”</p>

<p>“Oh, give the poor thing a chance,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>“How are we going to meet him, anyway?”
asked Aleck. “It would look kind
o’ funny for the whole bunch to go up to the
front door——”</p>

<p>“Wait till Norman gets back,” advised
Bob.</p>

<p>“But suppose the Colonel won’t listen, and
fires him out—what then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll have to see George Clayton, and
fix it up some way,” laughed Jack. “We
must back Norman to the finish in this affair—eh,
Joe?”</p>

<p>“That’s one of our jobs; but are we standing
here for our health, or to ornament the
landscape?”</p>

<p>“Right you are; let’s walk around a bit.”</p>

<p>Not far away, they found the principal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
street, running straight back from the river.
At the foot of this was the ferry landing, and,
as the group came up, the Tarrytown boat was
swinging rapidly in.</p>

<p>“Solid-looking craft,” remarked Aleck.</p>

<p>“Has to be,” said Jack. “Guess it’s nearly
four miles across, and once in a while they run
up against some pretty bad storms.”</p>

<p>The boys found much to interest them.
The neat dwellings, surrounded by pretty gardens;
the stores, and a fire house, all claimed
their attention.</p>

<p>At an automobile supply store, Jack left an
order for an ample quantity of gasoline, to be
delivered that afternoon.</p>

<p>The situation of Nyack is very charming,
and the boys did not wonder that it has become
quite a popular summer resort.</p>

<p>In about an hour, they were back at the
house-boat, but Norman had not yet returned.</p>

<p>“Now, fellows,” remarked Aleck, “I’m going
to finish that story about Joe Archer.”</p>

<p>“You had him at the Battery, last time,”
grinned Joe.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. It’s rich. Well, it was this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
way: Joe Archer was strutting around in the
park, with that great walk of his, when, all
of a sudden, he saw——”</p>

<p>“Say, that chap’s a dandy rider,” interrupted
Joe. “Sits on his horse like a little
major.”</p>

<p>“And the horse is a crackerjack, too,” put
in Tom.</p>

<p>A boy on a white saddle-horse was rapidly
approaching along the road.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as his eye rested on the house-boat
and group in front, he reined in.</p>

<p>“Whoa, there, Bucephalus, whoa!” he exclaimed.
“Steady, boy—whoa! Hello, you
chaps, what is that funny-looking thing, anyway?”</p>

<p>“What does it look like?” asked Joe, witheringly.</p>

<p>“Like an old log hut that had broken loose
from somewhere, and floated somewhere else.
Whoa, you cheeky beggar! Say—belong to
you chaps, eh?”</p>

<p>“You guessed it the first time,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s the funniest-looking thing that
ever floated around these parts. Ever see a
horse dance before? Whoa, Bucephalus!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
Where’d you come from, and where are you
going?”</p>

<p>“The ‘Gray Gull,’ from New York, bound
to Albany; Jack Lyons, master,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“To Albany?” The boy whistled. “Jolly
good distance—but what a dandy idea. Great
Scott, I wish I could go on a trip like that!
Take passengers?”</p>

<p>“We’ve taken one, already,” laughed Jack.</p>

<p>“How about another?”</p>

<p>“We might——”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let your enthusiasm bubble
over too much. But, say—honest, I am interested.
Bucephalus won’t let me talk.
Want to come up to the house a minute?”</p>

<p>“Where is it?”</p>

<p>“That big one, with the columns in front.”</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other in surprise,
and Jack murmured, “Well, did you ever?”</p>

<p>“My name’s George Clayton,” the boy rattled
on. “Coming?—good! Now mind—don’t
back out.”</p>

<p>Next instant, Bucephalus leaped forward,
George Clayton waved his hand to the boys,
and galloped down the road.</p>

<p>“Well, doesn’t it beat the Dutch that we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
should run into him like this?” mused Aleck.
“Good-looking chap, too; but cheeky. Nice
of him to invite us to the house, though.
Shall we say anything about Norman?”</p>

<p>“Not at first,” advised Jack. “Guess we’ll
meet him at the house, anyway; and if we
don’t, leave the talking to me.”</p>

<p>When the boys arrived at the gate, and entered
between the high, sculptured posts which
stood on either side, horse and rider had disappeared
back of the palatial Greek mansion.</p>

<p>Shrubbery and flower beds were strewn
about with orderly profusion; cedars and
other trees dotted the green, sloping lawn,
and statues, mellowed in tone by contact with
the elements, stood out sharply against the
background. On the soft, languorous air
floated the mingling scents of many flowers,
and the sun-kissed paths, and shady nooks,
and rustic benches were a delight to look upon.</p>

<p>Soon they reached the white-pillared pergola,
heavy in the scent of grape-vines, with
the thick masses of leaves flashing green and
gold, and the graveled walk beneath streaked
with purple shadows. On either side of a
broad flight of steps leading to the terrace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
around the mansion were Greek vases
mounted on high pedestals.</p>

<p>For several moments, the boys surveyed the
handsome façade, with its six columns and
sculptured reliefs in the tympanum above,
and wondered how it must feel to live in such
a place.</p>

<p>Then George Clayton, with undignified
haste, appeared around a corner.</p>

<p>“I was afraid you chaps wouldn’t turn
up,” he said, waving his hand. “Come
along; I want to hear about that trip,” and
his tone grew imperious, as if he were accustomed
to having his commands obeyed.</p>

<p>The visitors, nothing loth, sprang quickly
up the steps.</p>

<p>As they passed an open window, the sound
of voices floated out. Apparently a rather
animated discussion was in progress, and the
lads exchanged furtive glances.</p>

<p>George Clayton, too, seemed interested. He
paused for an instant; then, with a shrug of
his shoulders, led the way toward a handsome
stable and garage in the rear.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a workshop there,” he explained,
“though it’s precious little work I do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>“Greek workshop?” asked Joe, with a grin.</p>

<p>George looked at him quizzically.</p>

<p>“Smart—very smart boy,” he said. “I
see your education has been attended to.
Yes, everything Greek, here—except the
automobile. Uncle Dan’s got a hobby for
Greek stuff.”</p>

<p>As they entered the stable a short, slight
man, with a dark, flowing moustache, looked
up in surprise.</p>

<p>“Ma foi!” he exclaimed. “Master George,
how you scare me—so many peepuls. Does
monsieur, your uncle, want the automobile
this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know, Pierre,” answered George,
and he bounded lightly up-stairs, followed
by the four.</p>

<p>“That’s Pierre Dufour, our French chauffeur,”
said the boy, when they had entered
a room adjoining the hay-loft. “Speaks
rather funny English; but I practice my
French on him, and how the poor chap
stands it I don’t know. Parlez vous Français?”</p>

<p>“Not on your life,” said Jack, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Et moi pas beaucoup, which means I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
don’t know much either,” said the millionaire
boy. “But never mind. Sit down
anywhere you can. Honest, it’s funny to
have a whole lot of fellows here and not
know one of your names. But I’m always
doing funny things; Uncle Dan says so, anyway.”</p>

<p>The boys quickly introduced themselves.</p>

<p>“You have a dandy place to work in,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>“And such a fine room to sit around and
read,” sighed Fred. “Got a lot of books,
too.”</p>

<p>“Well, just keep away from ’em for once,”
grinned Joe.</p>

<p>“But let’s hear about your trip,” said
George, with a slightly impatient gesture.
“I’m awfully curious; must be simply
great.”</p>

<p>Jack explained, and George’s eyes began to
sparkle.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, with a long breath, “that’s
just the kind of a trip I’d like to take. You
see, fellows,” he went on, confidentially, “I’d
like to rough it a bit, and forget all about
mussing up my clothes and getting my hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
dirty. You chaps may think it funny that I
want to butt in, when I never saw you before;
but you look like the right sort, and I guess
we could get together all right. Hang it, I’m
sick of having everything I want thrown at
me. There—it’s out now. Knocking around
does a chap a world of good.”</p>

<p>“Nothing better,” agreed Bob Somers.</p>

<p>“Well, will you take another passenger?
I was going to Albany at the end of the week,
anyway. I’ll pay you well.”</p>

<p>Jack glanced at his chums, and they
nodded.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” he answered. “Never mind
about the pay; but you’ll have to rough it a
bit.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you that’s just what I want
to do?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps your guardian will object?”</p>

<p>“I generally have a way of doing what I
like,” said George, dryly; “though once in
a while uncle puts up an awful kick.”</p>

<p>“We were going to leave this afternoon,”
suggested Joe.</p>

<p>“I can easily catch up with you if your
house-boat doesn’t put on too much speed,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
laughed George. “Pierre can make that auto
fairly hum. But come ahead, fellows, and
take a look at the house.”</p>

<p>The interior of the Greek mansion, they
found, was fully up to the standard set by
the exterior. It was only two stories in
height, but the rooms were large and imposing.
A broad stairway led up to the
gallery, at the four corners of which were
blue and gold Ionic columns. The ornate
railing was in the same scheme of color,
while suspended from it were gorgeous draperies
imported from China and Japan.</p>

<p>When George led the way into the atrium,
a room of marble and mosaic, with a beautiful
little fountain in the center, the boys
opened their eyes with wonder. At both ends
were statues and marble benches.</p>

<p>“Like it?” asked George.</p>

<p>“Well, I should say so,” answered Jack,
with admiration in his tones. “Never saw
anything to beat it.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” added Fred Winter.</p>

<p>“Some of your friends, George?”</p>

<p>Turning, the boys saw a tall, well-built man
with a military carriage surveying them with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
a questioning look. His hair and moustache
were iron-gray. His aquiline nose and keen
gray eyes would ordinarily have given him
an air of sternness, but, at the present moment,
this was greatly increased by his very
evident look of annoyance.</p>

<p>“Never saw them until to-day, uncle,” replied
George, cheerfully.</p>

<p>Colonel Ellison’s frown deepened.</p>

<p>“Never saw them until to-day!” he echoed,
somewhat to the embarrassment of the house-boat
boys. “How is that?”</p>

<p>“Uncle,” said George, without replying to
his question, “this is Jack Lyons, of New
York——”</p>

<p>“Jack Lyons—any relation to Mr. John
Lyons, the New York lawyer?”</p>

<p>“My father,” said Jack, promptly.</p>

<p>“H’m.” The Colonel’s face relaxed somewhat.
“I know him by reputation—a good
lawyer and useful citizen,” he said, less stiffly.</p>

<p>Then, with a bow, Colonel Ellison turned
abruptly on his heel.</p>

<p>“Uncle isn’t in a good humor to-day,” remarked
George, calmly. “Something must
have upset him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>“Say, George,” whispered Jack Lyons, as
they stood at the front door, “I want to tell
you something—Norman Redfern is with us.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried the other, in the greatest
surprise. “How in the dickens did you ever
run across him? I want to know all about
this.”</p>

<p>And linking arms with Jack, he led the
way out to the pergola.</p>

<p>Jack briefly explained.</p>

<p>“Now I know what disturbed my guardian,”
said George, with a low whistle. “Why
didn’t you tell me at first?”</p>

<p>“Thought we’d let it go for a while,”
grinned Joe.</p>

<p>“Well—Norman is a peach,” said George,
slowly. “But Uncle Dan is awfully set
against him, and I guess it didn’t do him a
bit of good to come here. Too bad. Honest, I
never knew what the row was about. I asked
Norman, but he’s a sensitive chap, and grew
red in the face, and stammered; and Uncle
Dan said, ‘It’s not necessary for you to know,
young man,’ and when he says ‘young man’
to me that ends it. But I’d stick up for
Norman every time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>“And so should I,” said Jack, warmly.
“Wish we could help him out.”</p>

<p>“But how can we, when none of us even
knows what it’s about?” said George, in a perplexed
tone. “Jiminy, I’ll try to get him
to tell me. Let’s go down to the house-boat.”</p>

<p>But Norman Redfern was nowhere to be
seen, and, after waiting for some time, George
took his leave.</p>

<p>“Remember, fellows, keep an eye open for
a big gasoline tank and cushioned seats,”
were his parting words.</p>

<p>“And now, Joe, what do you think of the
millionaire boy?” asked Jack, when the former
was out of hearing.</p>

<p>“He’s all right,” said Joe.</p>

<p class="ph3">IN THE AUTOMOBILE</p>


<p>George Clayton did not broach the subject
of his trip that afternoon. Colonel Ellison
was still decidedly out of sorts, and George
knew from experience how he should be approached.</p>

<p>But the boy had been too long pampered
and indulged to make him regard the prospect
with any trepidation. The Colonel
might object—he often did that, but only to
capitulate in the end in the face of his ward’s
importunities—and the present case seemed
only to call for a little tact.</p>

<p>“I’m going,” muttered the boy to himself,
“and I’d like to see anybody try to stop me.”</p>

<p>After dinner that evening Colonel Ellison’s
frown had departed and George entered his
study with confidence.</p>

<p>“Uncle,” he said, “you remember last
week I spoke about going to Albany; well,
I’d like to start to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>Colonel Ellison laid down his pen, and
glanced inquiringly over the rim of his eyeglasses.</p>

<p>“One of your school chums lives there, I
believe?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; and I want to get a chance to see
him again before I’m bundled off bag and
baggage to college.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see any objections,” said the
Colonel, slowly. “Remember the advice I
have given you on previous occasions. And
now, George, I’m extremely busy to-night,
getting ready for a meeting of the board to-morrow,
and I don’t wish to be disturbed
under any pretext, as I must take an early
train for New York in the morning.”</p>

<p>“But, uncle,” said George, “I wanted to ask
you if——”</p>

<p>Colonel Ellison frowned, and impatiently
seized his pen.</p>

<p>“You have my permission,” he said sharply.
“Not another word, young man.”</p>

<p>He waved his hand, and George left the
room.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s not my fault if he doesn’t like
it,” thought the boy. “Let’s see how things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
stand. I have his permission to go to Albany;
he said ‘Jack Lyons’ father is a good lawyer
and useful citizen’; in that case, Jack must
be all right, too. Besides, he would have
consented—of course he would.” And, having
satisfied himself that everything was as
it ought to be, George retired, with pleasant
visions of his trip.</p>

<p>Colonel Ellison left before George had a
chance to see him, and the latter ate a hasty
breakfast alone, his aunt having also gone to
New York.</p>

<p>Then he packed up a few necessary belongings,
donned one of his oldest suits, and
made his way to the garage.</p>

<p>“Bon jour, Pierre,” he said.</p>

<p>“Bon jour, monsieur,” returned the Frenchman,
politely. “You desire to speak with
me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, get out the machine, Pierre. We’ll
have a spin.”</p>

<p>Pierre looked at his young master’s clothes,
and arched his eyebrows; then, with a slight
gesture, turned toward the car.</p>

<p>“When monsieur is ready, I will be, too,”
he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>“I’m ready now.”</p>

<p>“Ma foi!” But beyond this momentary
expression of surprise, Pierre made no comment,
and, in a few minutes, he announced
his readiness to go.</p>

<p>George deposited his suit case in the car,
and took his place beside him.</p>

<p>“Let ’er rip,” he said.</p>

<p>“What is rip?” asked Pierre. “My coat?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” laughed the other. “Allez vite—go
fast.”</p>

<p>“Ma foi! I see—you speak such funny
English. Ha, ha! Yes, we let her rip,
which not means that I tear the machine to
pieces.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” laughed George. “The car belongs
to me, you know—bought it with my
own cash. When that’s to be done, I’ll attend
to it myself.”</p>

<p>The touring car was soon passing between
the gate-posts at the entrance.</p>

<p>“Now, where?” asked Pierre.</p>

<p>“Follow the river.”</p>

<p>George settled back on the cushioned seat
with a sigh of contentment. The morning
was pleasant, with enough air stirring to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
temper the heat; and the broad Hudson
sparkled and gleamed between the trees like
silver. Birds were singing and flitting about;
a couple of red squirrels dashed frantically
across the sunlit road, making for the nearest
tree, and were soon lost to view amidst the
foliage. It was all very pleasant and cheerful,
and George’s shining eyes told of his enjoyment.</p>

<p>“How far we go?” asked the chauffeur,
presently.</p>

<p>“Oh, a good way yet, Pierre; I’m bound
for Albany.”</p>

<p>“Ma foi!” exclaimed the Frenchman, in
great astonishment. “But why you not say
that before we go wrong way?” and he
brought the machine to a standstill.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, it’s all right, Pierre,” laughed
George. “Keep straight ahead till I tell
you to stop. I’m not going to the railroad
station.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you take a boat, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a kind of one.”</p>

<p>And Pierre, sorely puzzled, shook his head,
and muttered, “Ma foi” several times, under
his breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>The boy’s eyes were constantly roving over
the river for any signs of the “Gray Gull”;
but half an hour passed, and it had not been
sighted in any of the numerous little coves,
or along the broad sweep of the river.</p>

<p>“Wonder where in the dickens it can
have gone to,” murmured George, with a
sudden fear that his plans might after all go
astray.</p>

<p>“What you say?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, Pierre; I was only thinking.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” muttered the Frenchman, and he
contracted his brow, and cast a very strange
look at his young companion.</p>

<p>“Hooray! I see it!” exclaimed George,
suddenly. “Put on a bit more speed, Pierre.
That funny-looking house-boat is what I’m
after.”</p>

<p>“Eight seconds I take you there, but for
the law,” said Pierre. “We go fast, but slow,
too. Is it enough?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” cried George, holding on tight.
“Whizz! Look at that trail of dust behind
us!”</p>

<p>A few moments later, the millionaire boy
was waving his arms, while the puzzled expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
on Pierre’s face grew into one of
positive wonderment.</p>

<p>“Hello, Jack—hello!”</p>

<p>An answering hail came over the water,
and the “Gray Gull” began to put inshore.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Pierre; we don’t go any further,”
said George, his eyes sparkling with
pleasure. “You can skip back home.”</p>

<p>“Ma foi! You—you go on that thing,
Monsieur George? It isn’t possible. No—no;
you say it for to make a laugh—what
you call it in English a joke; ees that not
it?”</p>

<p>“Joke, nothing, Pierre. Just wait here a
minute and you’ll see me sailing away.”</p>

<p>“I no understand it, monsieur. Your
uncle, he knows?”</p>

<p>“Now look here, Pierre,” said George,
whose eyes were beginning to flash; “I
don’t see that it’s any of your affair. I’m
surprised at you. Stop here, and I’ll get
out.”</p>

<p>“Ha—that man again,” cried the chauffeur,
suddenly. “Ah, ha, monsieur your uncle say
to him, ‘Keep away—I no want you here.’
Yes, saire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>“Great Scott!” gasped George. “If it
isn’t Norman Redfern standing on the deck.
Well, of all things! I thought he had gone
back to the Palisades.”</p>

<p>Although more than glad to see his former
tutor, George was vexed that the chauffeur
should have noted his presence, especially as
Pierre had, for some reason or other, taken a
strong dislike to him and never made any effort
to conceal it. Then, again, he felt that
his uncle would certainly object to his traveling
in company with the young man whom
he had so unceremoniously discharged; yet
to back out now would be to put upon Norman
a slight which he felt was not deserved.</p>

<p>The result of these cogitations was to make
George very irritable indeed; and Pierre’s
next words added fuel to his feelings.</p>

<p>“Yes, saire, he say, ‘Keep away—I no want
you here;’ and you go with that man, Monsieur
George? Ma foi—pouf! What will
monsieur the Colonel say?”</p>

<p>George, suit case in hand, had stepped to
the ground.</p>

<p>“Cut it out, Pierre,” he exclaimed, angrily.
“You have the worst nerve I ever heard of.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption">“HIS EYES SNAPPED FIERCELY”</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“I understand monsieur the Colonel’s English;
but not yours, sometimes,” returned the
chauffeur, in withering accents.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll understand it pretty fast
when I get back home. Unless you learn
your place a bit better, I’ll have you fired.
Hello, Jack! Hello, Norman! Be with you
in a moment.”</p>

<p>“Fired—fired! What you mean by
fired?”</p>

<p>“Sent off—discharged, stupid.”</p>

<p>A wave of intelligence crossed Pierre’s face;
his eyes snapped fiercely.</p>

<p>“You have insult me,” he said, haughtily.
“Very well—we see. Bah! And if he say
anything to me,” indicating Norman by a
wave of his hand, “I smack him in the face
like this,” and Pierre smote the air with considerable
force.</p>

<p>George looked at him for a moment in silence.
Then the chauffeur’s ludicrous expression
caused his own angry feelings to suddenly
vanish; he burst into a hearty laugh,
much to the astonishment and disgust of
Pierre, and, picking up his suit case, walked
toward the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>“Hello, George! What’s the row?” asked
Jack Lyons, from the deck of the “Gray
Gull.” “Did you try your French on him
again?”</p>

<p>“Wait a second, Jack; very glad to see you,
Norman,” and the rich boy’s tone spoke of his
sincerity. “Hello, what’s that duffer up
to?”</p>

<p>Pierre, whose Latin blood was thoroughly
aroused, had started forward.</p>

<p>“You have insult me!” he cried. “And
for why?—For him,” pointing to Norman
Redfern. “I no stand it, monsieur; your
uncle shall hear—ma foi—he shall!”</p>

<p>“Duck him in the river, and cool him off,”
advised Joe.</p>

<p>“Ha, you call me ‘duck,’ hey? And I say
to you—‘goose’! Pouf! In the belle France,
children no talk like that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ring off,” remarked Joe, scornfully.</p>

<p>“I will myself to your uncle report,
and——”</p>

<p>“Don’t report any one else,” laughed Joe.</p>

<p>“By and by, I come for you with monsieur
the Colonel,” went on Pierre, fiercely. “You
say fired—fired, to me? Pouf—you see!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
and, with another wave of his hand, the excited
Frenchman was off, while the others
stood gazing after his retreating form in silence.</p>

<p class="ph3">GEORGE GOES ALONG</p>


<p>“Well, what do you think of that?” exclaimed
George, at length, with a disgusted
look. “Doesn’t it beat all? Just as I
thought I was going to have the jolliest kind
of time, that poor Frenchy has to try to spoil
the fun. I’m afraid he’ll do it, too.”</p>

<p>“But surely you told your uncle that you
were coming on the house-boat?” put in Norman
Redfern.</p>

<p>“I’ll explain in a second, Norm. Give
your old dory a shove, Jack—that’s it.
Whoa! This thing is most as bad as Bucephalus.”</p>

<p>In spite of his disturbed condition of mind
and the dory’s apparent desire to move in
every direction at once, George was landed
safely on the “Gray Gull.”</p>

<p>From the distance came the faint toot of an
automobile horn; the big red machine seemed
to be fairly flying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>“Scorching—speed laws busted,” grinned
Joe.</p>

<p>“Shake, Norman; I am real glad to see
you,” said George. “No, Uncle Dan didn’t
know I was coming on the ‘Gray Gull.’
Here’s the way it happened.”</p>

<p>And George, seating himself comfortably on
the bench, related his story.</p>

<p>“And doesn’t it seem the queerest thing in
the world that we should meet like this, Norman?”
he commented. “And all on account
of these chaps.”</p>

<p>The former tutor’s face had clouded over.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s very strange,” he said, gravely.
“And though I’m more than glad to see you,
George, I should advise you to go back.”</p>

<p>“Go back?” echoed George, with a decided
shake of his head. “I guess not. Do you
think I’d let Pierre crow over me? No, sir—why,
he deserves to be fired out, bag and baggage.”</p>

<p>“Certainly did act a bit snippy,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Must be a fussy fellow,” added Joe. “‘I
say to you, goose—pouf,’” and Joe laughed
heartily.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked George, reflectively,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
“there’s going to be a nice little row. I can
feel it coming; but it isn’t my fault. Anyway,
I’m tired of being looked after as though
I were like a pound of butter on a hot summer
day. I’m going to Albany on the ‘Gray
Gull.’”</p>

<p>Norman argued the point; but George’s expression
bespoke a determination which was
not to be shaken, and the others sided with
him. The former tutor was, therefore, forced
to yield.</p>

<p>“By the way, Norman, what makes Pierre
dislike you so much?” asked the rich boy,
presently.</p>

<p>“Pierre heard me discussing the French,
one evening, and not understanding English
very well, he thought, quite mistakenly, that
I had referred to la belle France in slighting
terms,” answered Norman, with a smile. “He
is excitable, and I couldn’t convince him of
his error.”</p>

<p>“That’s Pierre, all over,” grunted George.
“Say, how did you get along with Uncle Dan,
yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Not at all; he explained that I need not
call again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a downright shame.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you were surprised to see me
here?”</p>

<p>“You bet I was.”</p>

<p>“The boys persuaded me to keep on; and
it didn’t take much persuasion, either, for I
want to see my old alma mater, near Albany.”</p>

<p>“I tell you, fellows, I feel like a bird out
of a cage,” said George, stepping to the door.
“Look at these duds—it’s roughing it with
a vengeance, eh? Wait till Uncle Dan’s eyes
rest on ’em. For goodness’ sake, Jack, get
the old scow moving.”</p>

<p>“Just what I’m going to do; but the tide
is against us, and we’ll never beat out your
uncle’s auto.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps some constable will nab that
chauffeur,” remarked Joe, hopefully.</p>

<p>“Autos are not much on swimming, are
they?” suggested Tom Clifton. “And your
uncle’s hasn’t any wings; so we needn’t
worry. A little wireless conversation over
the water won’t hurt.”</p>

<p>“When Uncle Dan gets his dander up,
things are apt to hum,” said George, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
picked up Confuse-us by the nape of the neck,
and examined his pudgy little face. “He’ll
get back from the city about three, and
then——”</p>

<p>“Scorching, and ‘pouf,’ again,” grinned
Joe.</p>

<p>“You’ve hit it,” said George, with a laugh.
“But until trouble begins I’m going to enjoy
myself.”</p>

<p>Not far from Ossining, which is situated on
the eastern shore, the boys saw a narrow strip
of land jutting out into the river.</p>

<p>“Curious, isn’t it?” said Redfern.</p>

<p>The boys decided that it was. But they
voted down a proposition to cross the stream.</p>

<p>“I no run away from any trouble,” said
Joe, with a remarkable French accent.</p>

<p>“Haverstraw’s the next town,” declared
Jack Lyons.</p>

<p>“That’s where those barges loaded with
bricks come from,” explained Norman Redfern.
“No doubt you have often noticed
them. The annual production of the town
must be enormous.”</p>

<p>“Lots of boats around,” said Fred. “Wonder
where they all come from.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>“The great volume of traffic on the Hudson
is largely due to the Erie Canal,” explained
Norman. “Running from Albany to Lake
Erie, it connects the East and West. Wheat,
lumber, grain and many other products are
brought here, while from New York merchandise
is sent to many distributing points. The
Hudson is really an arm of the sea, with the
tide running as far as Albany.”</p>

<p>“There’s an old lumber boat out there,
now,” said George.</p>

<p>“Yes! Perhaps its cargo came all the way
from the forests of Wisconsin. Isn’t it a
picturesque sight, with those dingy gray
sails?”</p>

<p>“Looks great,” admitted Jack. “Funny
life—guess the captain’s an old, wrinkled
chap with a voice like a fog-horn.”</p>

<p>“Most of ’em are,” said Joe. “But look at
that dandy steam yacht. Isn’t she just scooting
along?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been on her several times,” put in
George, with his eye to the telescope. “Belongs
to a Wall street broker, a friend of Uncle
Dan’s. But there’s lots more fun on a house-boat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“You can bet; I wouldn’t change,” said
Bob.</p>

<p>The famous Highlands of the Hudson, consisting
of numerous ranges of hills, many over
a thousand feet high and a few of considerably
greater altitude, were now assuming definite
shape; Haverstraw Bay, a continuation
of the Tappan Sea, was coming to an end.</p>

<p>George almost forgot his troubles. Sitting
at his ease on the “promenade” deck, or
taking his turn at the tiller, he told the others
that he had never enjoyed himself more.</p>

<p>Haverstraw, with its kilns and factories, its
smoke, and the odd-shaped, precipitous mountain
which looks down upon it, was soon
passed.</p>

<p>The Highlands were now close at hand.
Above their lofty summits floated a succession
of hazy clouds, which sent fleeting shadows
to dim the fresh green of the tree-covered
slopes. And how steep and rugged they
were; with here and there bold, rocky forms
flashing into view between the vegetation.</p>

<p>While the “Gray Gull” slowly chugged its
way toward the narrow stretch of river a
sense of smallness came over the boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>“Looks as if the river ended,” cried Jack,
suddenly.</p>

<p>“Certainly does, skipper,” said Dave. “We
seem to be headed straight for the rocks.”</p>

<p>“Follow the water, and you’ll be all right,”
laughed Joe.</p>

<p>“We’re coming to what is known as the
‘Horse Race,’” explained Norman, “and,
as the tide is in our favor, we ought to
make good progress. Isn’t it magnificent,
boys?”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, twice!” cried Jack, enthusiastically.
“Simply great.”</p>

<p>The transition from the very broad expanse
of river to the narrowness of the gorge was
novel and interesting. Here and there the
steep slopes jutted out into the stream, and
Jack kept far enough from shore to hold a
straight course.</p>

<p>They soon found that the Horse Race was
well named. The water surged and swirled
along as if angry that the clumsy house-boat
should invade its domain. A fresh breeze
helped to agitate the surface, and the blue
waves sometimes rose high enough to splash
on deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>“Could anything be finer?” asked George,
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how,” responded Norman.</p>

<p>“I thought the Palisades were pretty high,”
said Jack, “but they are not much compared
with these.”</p>

<p>“Now we are going to be tossed about a bit—here
comes an excursion steamer,” remarked
Fred.</p>

<p>A huge white boat, standing out clearly
against the dark background, rapidly approached,
the smoke from its funnels floating
backward in a long, bluish streak. Jack
got his clumsy craft as far out of the way as
possible, and the “Gray Gull” rode out the
huge swells with many a lurch and wobble.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cried Joe. “Never even
touched the bottom.”</p>

<p>George took his hand off the support which
had enabled him to remain erect, and said,
“Guess I needn’t bother about Uncle Dan
just now.”</p>

<p>“An automobile along here ought to make
a hit,” said Aleck.</p>

<p>“You bet; and an awful splash when the
pieces struck the water.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>Joe Preston laughed loudly at his own
words, and the others, except Fred Winter,
rewarded him by an appreciative smile.</p>

<p>“So, at the present moment,” went on
George, with a sigh of satisfaction, “there is
nothing to bother us. What are you doing
with those pieces of board, Norman—going to
make a rest for the telescope?”</p>

<p>“Yes—so that we can study the stars.”</p>

<p>“That’s a great idea,” said Fred Winter.
“Joe, here, needs special instruction in most
everything; and a bit of astronomy may help.”</p>

<p>“And while you are about it,” giggled Joe,
“add a course on bookworms and diplomacy.”</p>

<p>“And on the awful fate that overtakes
young chaps who are always going to do, but
never start,” retaliated Fred.</p>

<p>“So that we shall have a little floating college,
all to ourselves, and with rather unusual
branches,” chimed in Norman, with a smile.</p>

<p>The swift tide carried the “Gray Gull”
ahead at a lively pace, and the views seemed
to grow more and more picturesque. Nature
seemed to have combined the wild and grand
with the delicate and poetic; dark, frowning
crags above; and sylvan dells below. Here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
the banks steep and rugged, with the shadowed
river rushing swiftly by; there, gentle, sloping
stretches, whose sunlit groves seemed to
extend a cheerful welcome. At another place,
the hills on the right opened out, giving them
a glimpse of the far distance, with deep blue
mountain forms.</p>

<p>And on this late summer day, with the
white clouds floating overhead and a tender,
dreamy effect enveloping the entire landscape,
the boys felt like breaking forth into
song. And they did; and the result, while
not especially harmonious, proved that their
hearts were as light as the glancing beams
which traveled across the hills and valleys.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” said Bob Somers, at length, “I
move that to-night we do the Nimrod act;
camping out will be good for a change.”</p>

<p>“Agreed!” answered Jack. “Plenty of
good places around. It will be great; build
a fire and cook our grub like you Rambler
chaps used to do.”</p>

<p>“And afterward, we can take a look at the
stars,” said Fred, with his usual solemnity.</p>

<p>Miles and miles were traversed, and still the
Highlands continued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“I say, my jolly tars,” remarked Jack, suddenly,
“we’re coming to West Point. It’s on
that hill to the left.”</p>

<p>“Such a place as this is enough to make a
fellow feel like becoming a soldier,” said
Aleck. “Those lads must have a dandy
time.”</p>

<p>“The discipline is very strict,” said Norman,
“and they have to study hard. But
our future generals have probably as fine a
military academy, and one as well situated as
any in the world.”</p>

<p>At this point, the river takes a bend to the
west; then, a short distance further up, the
general northerly direction of the channel is
resumed.</p>

<p>The “Gray Gull” slowly rounded the base
of West Point, the boys, in ease and comfort,
enjoying the changing scenes. As the course
of the house-boat was again changed, a magnificent
view opened out before them. A placid
reach, considerably wider than the one they
had just traversed, stretched far off toward
the horizon. A mountain rose on either
hand, while beyond these the vista melted
into the bluish haze of distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“Perfectly stunning,” cried Dave, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Storm King Mountain to the west; the
other is known as Break Neck Hill,” explained
Redfern.</p>

<p>“And it looks it,” said Jack. “Whew!
Did you ever see such a pile of slippery-looking
rock?”</p>

<p>“It’s about twice as high as the Palisades,”
went on Redfern, unconsciously assuming the
air of a tutor, “and got its name from the
many accidents which have happened on its
steep, rocky sides. Imagine the dangerous
places which might be encountered by any
one climbing it.”</p>

<p>“But why should any one wish to?” asked
George.</p>

<p>Redfern laughed.</p>

<p>“Some people have a strange desire to
conquer the seemingly impossible,” he said,
dryly, “and, now and then, one pays the
penalty.”</p>

<p>The boys surveyed the vast pile with interest.
Stern and forbidding, it seemed to
frown menacingly upon the quiet water below.
Steep declivities, patches of barren<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
rocks and precipices make this mountain
strangely different from the verdured heights
close at hand.</p>

<p>Civilization has encroached upon the wild
grandeur of the scene. A railroad skirts the
base of the hill; and now a train rattles
along, the sharp blasts of its whistle being
flung in a series of echoes from hill to hill.</p>

<p>Storm King Mountain is a great rounded
pile, its base rising abruptly from the river.</p>

<p>The wonder and delight of the boys increased.</p>

<p>“This is one of the most celebrated places
on the Hudson,” declared Norman Redfern.
“I once heard Colonel Ellison say that it reminded
him of Lake Como, in Italy.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it seem shut in by the mountains?”
said George. “And only a little
further down it was miles across.”</p>

<p>Finally, the stream widened out, though
not like the Tappan Sea; the country became
less hilly, and looking back, they could see
the Highlands to the right and left, in a long,
unbroken line, their summits illuminated by
a delicate, rosy glow.</p>

<p>Another hour’s journey, and Bob, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
eyes were constantly roving about, exclaimed,
“Hello, look at those two motor boats tied
up by the shore!”</p>

<p>“The ‘Reindeer’ and ‘Dart,’” read Aleck,
after a moment’s survey through the telescope.</p>

<p>“That’s a swell place for camping out,” put
in Joe, pointing ahead. “Lots of trees to hide
the boat from any one on the road, if there is
one. George’s uncle would never think of
looking for us here.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, Joe,” agreed Jack, “and—what’s
the matter, Norman?”</p>

<p>The former tutor had just lowered the telescope.</p>

<p>“I’ve made quite a discovery, boys,” he answered,
with a smile. “One of those motor
boats belongs to the school which I attended,
and the other to the rival institution I told
you about.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! That’s interesting,” cried Jack.
“We might meet some of those chaps, and
have a jolly good time together. Here’s where
we camp for the night.”</p>

<p class="ph3">PIERRE CATCHES UP</p>


<p>“You can go a bit further in, Jack,” said
Joe, who was busy sounding with the lead.</p>

<p>“Too much risk of getting the propeller all
choked up with weeds, Joe, old boy. Shut
off the power, Norman; that’s right. Give
me a hand with the anchor, George. Good!
Now, fellows, we are all right for the night.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any of those school chaps
around; do you?” asked Tom, presently.</p>

<p>“No,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Wonder what in thunder they are doing,
so far away from Albany; and how is it that
the rivals are together?”</p>

<p>“Say, does this sort of thing go on every
year? I’d jolly well like to join.”</p>

<p>Norman smiled, as the volley of questions
was fired at him.</p>

<p>“Give me a chance, boys, and I’ll explain,”
he said. “No! I don’t believe the boys are
together. Most likely there is the same
rivalry as before; and they are having lots of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
fun at each other’s expense. You see, the
seniors of Ripley Academy—my school—formed
a motor boat club; and every year,
just before school begins, they take a long
cruise on the Hudson. Thornton Preparatory
School, not to be outdone, followed their example,
and this time the rival clubs may have
met by chance, or, perhaps, one followed the
other.”</p>

<p>“Should think they’d leave some chaps on
guard,” murmured Tom.</p>

<p>“Probably a truce has been declared,”
smiled Norman. “But if you don’t see some
lively times when the boys get back, things
have changed since I left the school.”</p>

<p>“And I hope we do,” said Bob, briskly.
“We may give ’em a bit of help, too.”</p>

<p>“Now let’s get our stuff on shore, and do
the camping out in the best style.”</p>

<p>“Wonder if the fish would bite, out here,”
mused Aleck.</p>

<p>“Put your hand in the water and see,”
snickered Joe.</p>

<p>“No fooling, fellows; but lend a hand,”
said Jack. “Fire to start and grub to cook,
you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>Within a few minutes, the boys had gathered
and chopped a quantity of wood, an old,
decaying log close by furnishing most of the
fuel. Then the bright flames began twisting
and curling, sending aloft a shower of sparks,
while the smoke lazily drifted away among
the trees.</p>

<p>“We’re just as good as woodsmen at this
game even if we do come from the city,” remarked
Jack.</p>

<p>“Some fellows would have been crazy
enough to try and cook their grub hunter
fashion,” added Joe, with a wink at Bob.</p>

<p>A slice of ham was soon sizzling away;
then the coffee-pot began to simmer over a
pile of glowing embers. Sardines, biscuits
and gingerbread completed the supper, which
all the boys thoroughly enjoyed.</p>

<p>By the time they had cleaned up, the
clouds above were edged with an orange glow.
Between the trees close at hand, they caught
glimpses in the western sky of brilliant yellows,
pinks, and purples, and pale, delicate
greens, all forming a riot of color which rivaled
that of the rainbow.</p>

<p>“Must be a jolly fine sunset,” said George;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
“I’m going to take a walk and get a good
look at it. Coming, fellows?”</p>

<p>All but Norman assented.</p>

<p>“I’ll stick by the ‘Gray Gull,’ George,” he
said; “and work on that telescope stand a
bit. It will be a fine night for a peep at the
moon, too, which should be at its best.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said George. “If those school
chaps get back, tell ’em to wait. Funny the
duffers are staying away so long.”</p>

<p>The five plunged directly into the woods.
A touch of the warm sunset glow rested upon
the foliage and tree trunks, relieving the
somber tones of the denser portions. Over
vines and masses of ferns, with George in the
lead, they went, listening to the chatter and
song of the birds so soon to be hushed by the
approaching night.</p>

<p>“Haven’t enjoyed myself like this for
a year,” declared George, enthusiastically.
“It’s grand to feel as free as one of these
birds. Guess I can square it with Uncle Dan.”</p>

<p>“And ‘Pouf,’ too?” asked Joe, with a grin.</p>

<p>“Pierre may learn a few things,” said
George, with a touch of anger in his voice.
“Say—isn’t that a road ahead?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>“Surest thing you know,” said Jack.
“And the woods end right here; and I’m
glad of it—about forty-five twigs have scraped
acquaintance with my face already. Great
Scott, what’s that?”</p>

<p>A weird cry suddenly echoed through the
woods; then from the distance came another.</p>

<p>“Only an owl, Jack,” laughed Bob.
“Thought you were going to jump out of
your boots.”</p>

<p>“Make an all-fired racket, don’t they?”
murmured Jack, slightly confused.</p>

<p>“Here’s the road, fellows. Lovely view of
the sunset. Going to put this in your history,
Joe?”</p>

<p>“You bet.”</p>

<p>“Begin to-night?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Joe, in very uncertain
tones. “Say! Where are we going now?”</p>

<p>“This way,” said George, waving his hand.</p>

<p>“I’d rather go in the other direction,” objected
Joe. “Looks more interesting, eh,
Jack?”</p>

<p>“Count me in, old boy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with George,” said Bob Somers.</p>

<p>“Think I’ll go that way, too,” put in Dave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>“So shall I,” added Tom.</p>

<p>Aleck and Fred studied the situation a
moment and also decided to cast their lot with
George.</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Jack. “Have your
own way. We’ll meet you here, after a bit.
Come on, Joe.” And the boys separated.</p>

<p>The road was wide and lined here and there
with trees and fences. Broad fields extended
off toward the low-lying hills, now purple
against the sunset sky. It was a pleasant
pastoral scene, with farmhouses and growing
crops and patches of trees.</p>

<p>The two wandered along until the glow had
faded from the clouds and a grayness was beginning
to steal over the landscape.</p>

<p>“Better be skipping back now, Joe,” remarked
Jack. “It’s getting kind o’ late;
and you’ve got that history to write.”</p>

<p>“And you could begin makin’ some pictures
for it,” gurgled Joe.</p>

<p>When the two arrived at the place where
the others had parted from them, they found
it deserted; so Jack seated himself on a broad
slab of rock, while Joe idly leaned against a
fence close by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe the whole bunch got tired, and
went back to the boat,” remarked Jack,
presently. “We won’t wait here all night,
either. Say! There’s an auto coming along
to beat the band.”</p>

<p>“Let it come,” said Joe, absently; he was
looking for a chance to tickle Jack on the
back of the neck with a blade of grass.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer the car approached, until
its red color was faintly distinguished; the
two acetylene lamps threw a dazzling glare,
to pierce the gathering gloom.</p>

<p>To the surprise of both boys, it suddenly
slackened speed, and just as it came abreast,
halted. A stern-looking man, leaning forward,
stared down at them.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” thought Jack, with something
like a start; “it’s George Clayton’s
Uncle Dan!”</p>

<p class="ph3">COLONEL ELLISON TAKES A HAND</p>


<p>“Look here, boys,” exclaimed Colonel
Ellison, in a voice that plainly indicated the
ruffled state of his feelings, “have you seen a
house-boat with a party of rascally young
scamps on board?”</p>

<p>Quite startled at the situation in which they
so unexpectedly found themselves, neither
Jack nor Joe answered for an instant.</p>

<p>Each was sure that the fiery Colonel would
recognize them, and pour forth his vials of
wrath upon their heads.</p>

<p>But the gathering dusk and the Colonel’s
short-sightedness came to their rescue.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter—can’t you speak?”
demanded Colonel Ellison, impatiently.</p>

<p>“No, we haven’t seen any rascally boys,”
answered Jack, in a voice so unlike his own
that Joe narrowly escaped a laugh.</p>

<p>Colonel Ellison did not seem to notice the
evasion of his question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>“A party of young scoundrels and a rascally
tutor, whom I recently discharged, had
the audacity to induce my nephew to run
away,” he stormed, angrily.</p>

<p>Jack and Joe exchanged swift glances at
this piece of news.</p>

<p>“And it will go hard with them,” went on
the Colonel, with a vigorous movement of his
arm. “How far is the river from here?”</p>

<p>“Only a short distance,” answered Jack,
scorning, even at the risk of possible consequences,
to mislead the angry gentleman.</p>

<p>“But monsieur the Colonel,” put in the
chauffeur, eagerly, “ze boat-house must be
near. Ma foi! ze man just back, he see it pass
in ze afternoon, en route; and we shall catch
ze scamp before it makes ze night. Ha! Vat
ees this?”</p>

<p>A half dozen boys were swinging along the
road, singing as if every note gave them the
greatest possible enjoyment.</p>

<p>They were solid, lusty-looking chaps, and
the house-boat boys watched them approach
with interest. So did Colonel Ellison and his
chauffeur.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, boys,” said the former,
abruptly. “Have you seen a house-boat in
this vicinity?”</p>

<p>“A queer-looking pile of logs?” queried
one of the students, as the group stopped short
and surrounded the automobile.</p>

<p>“Yes, that ees it!” cried Pierre, quickly.
“You see him—where?”</p>

<p>“He was on the river,” replied the spokesman,
with a laugh. “Can’t be very far from
here. Your private yacht?”</p>

<p>Colonel Ellison glared very sternly over the
rim of his glasses at the author of this audacious
speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>“Ah!” he said; and the tone was so
ominous that the students were interested at
once.</p>

<p>“If you young men will lead the way to
the place, I’ll pay you for the service,” continued
Colonel Ellison, coldly. “My nephew
is aboard that boat, associating with a parcel
of young rascals, who have no better way of
using their time than to be cavorting along
the river in a shackly mud-scow.”</p>

<p>“Awful—terrible—frightful,” murmured
the student, nudging his neighbor in the ribs.
“Run away from home, has he? Hello, you
two chaps! Thought you were a couple of
statues—you stood so still.”</p>

<p>“Hello yourself,” came in Jack’s weak
falsetto.</p>

<p>“Same here,” said Joe, in his heaviest
tones.</p>

<p>“Belong around these parts?”</p>

<p>“Belong where our feet find us,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“But ze boat-house,” interrupted Pierre.
“Ma foi—if you no hurry, Monsieur le
Colonel, ze scamp have ze time to give you
what you call it, ze slip—ees that not it?”</p>

<p>“You are right, Pierre,” said Colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
Ellison, with dignity. “We are fortunate to
have met these young gentlemen. That
rascally tutor will find that he made a mistake.
If it is possible, I shall make an example
of him. Show us the house-boat, please.”</p>

<p>“I say,” whispered Joe, “did you ever hear
of such mean luck? These chaps are going
to get us in a peck o’ trouble. What’s to be
done?”</p>

<p>“Face the music and toot a little, to help it
along,” said Jack, calmly.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a lively tune while it
lasts, I’ll bet,” grinned Joe. “Let’s make a
flank movement, and by the time they get
there, we’ll be out in the river a bit.”</p>

<p>“But how about George and the others?”
asked Jack, in perplexed tones.</p>

<p>“You’ve got me there, Jack; but come on,
or that crowd will be away ahead of us in no
time.”</p>

<p>Already Colonel Ellison’s tall form was following
the students.</p>

<p>Pierre Dufour, leaning back on the cushioned
seat, rubbed his hands with satisfaction,
and murmured, “Ma foi, we have it, zis boat-house,
yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>The academy boys had again taken up
their jolly refrain; and soon their forms
were lost to view in the dim and silent
woods.</p>

<p>Jack and Joe found that their plan of
executing a side movement was much more
difficult than they had imagined. Neither
was sure of the way, and the woods were now
very dark. An astonishing number of obstructions
seemed to spring up on all sides.
Joe tripped over a fallen log and fell in the
midst of a mass of bushes; Jack ran full tilt
against a low-hanging branch, and soon they
were floundering about in such a dense growth
of underbrush that Jack halted.</p>

<p>“What silly chumps to come in here!” he
exclaimed, impatiently. “If those mean
lobsters weren’t nearly yelling their heads
off, I’d never know what direction they
took.”</p>

<p>“Fierce lot of trees and stuff,” grumbled
Joe. “Come within a foot of these vines and
they make a grab for a fellow.”</p>

<p>“And that branch swooped down and
banged me on purpose,” grinned Jack.
“Aren’t we in a mess, all tangled up in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
woods? Redfern’s going to catch fits; and
I guess George will be yanked back to
Nyack.”</p>

<p>“And just on account of those silly rah-rahs,”
growled Joe. “Say, did you notice
that chap, Bates?”</p>

<p>“Who could help it, with such a looking
face?”</p>

<p>“Like that smile of his?”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen scowls I liked better.”</p>

<p>Joe laughed.</p>

<p>“So have I,” he said. “But, by jinks,
look!”</p>

<p>“What at?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you see? There’s the river—the
wide, wet river, and just back of those
trees, too.”</p>

<p>“I believe you’re right.”</p>

<p>“Of course I am.”</p>

<p>And Joe, in desperation, literally forced his
way through a mass of bushes, with Jack close
at his heels.</p>

<p>Breathing hard, and bearing numerous
scratches, as a result of their encounter with
twigs, brambles and stickers, the two at length
reached the shore, and saw, to their great satisfaction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
that it extended on either hand in a
clear stretch.</p>

<p>“And there’s the ‘Gray Gull,’” cried Jack.
“Redfern has lighted the lanterns. Run like
the dickens, Joe; and we may get there by
the time the row starts.”</p>

<p>Both boys were good runners; and they
dashed ahead pell-mell.</p>

<p>Soon they saw seven dusky figures emerge
from the woods just ahead and make straight
toward the house-boat. Colonel Ellison was
now stalking pompously in the lead.</p>

<p>Another hard spurt; and Jack and Joe
dashed up just as the Colonel’s stentorian
voice rang out.</p>

<p>“Hey, you on board that scow, step outside!
I have a few words to say to you.”</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">“THAT CHAFFER FELLOW”</p>


<p>“Ma foi, I hope that monsieur the Colonel
finds that scamp,” murmured Pierre Dufour,
for the tenth time. “It was for him that
George run away; and for him that he insult
me; and for him that he say ‘fired’—‘fired’
to me. Bah! And what does monsieur the
Colonel say? He say, ‘Pierre, you have done
well; I make you my compliments.’ A la
bonne heure.”</p>

<p>And Pierre sank back, and gazed fixedly
toward the woods.</p>

<p>Soon the wait became monotonous; and,
thinking that beyond the road might lead
toward the river, where he could get a sight
of the house-boat, Pierre gave the starting
lever a pull, and the big red touring car was
again in motion.</p>

<p>Gliding slowly ahead, the chauffeur suddenly
heard the sound of voices, and, on looking
around, saw several shadowy figures approaching.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
He did not need to see their faces
in order to know that they were boys. They
seemed to be in high spirits.</p>

<p>In a few moments, the glare from the acetylene
lamps revealed a number of good-natured
faces staring into his own.</p>

<p>“Oh, look who’s here!” cried one.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, chaffer,” said another.</p>

<p>“Where are you bound for, show-fear?”
chimed in a third.</p>

<p>Pierre stopped the machine, and shrugged
his shoulders in characteristic French fashion.</p>

<p>“Ma foi, but these American boys are a
lively lot,” he commented to himself; then
aloud: “You have not, I suppose, seen a boat-house
near here?”</p>

<p>“A boat-house?” queried one.</p>

<p>“Ma foi! Yes. I am seeking a boy; he
run away from home—oh, such a fine home—and
join a party of scamps on a boat-house.
But monsieur his guardian, he——”</p>

<p>A hearty burst of laughter interrupted him,
and another peal brought a gleam into
Pierre’s black eyes.</p>

<p>“For why you laugh?” he demanded, suspiciously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>“Because, chaffer,” said one, “you made
a little slip.”</p>

<p>“A little slip? I no slip; what you mean?”</p>

<p>“In plain, unadulterated, unvarnished English,
chaffer, we say, if I grasp your meaning
aright, a ‘house-boat.’”</p>

<p>The giggles broke forth again.</p>

<p>“Ah, ees that it? We say not like that in
Français; ma foi, no. I would, in la belle
France, be driving an automobile rouge; and
the boy, he go off on a boat-house,” muttered
Pierre, shaking his head.</p>

<p>“So you’re after the kid to take him back
with you, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes; to-night he sit here, and whiz—it is
to Nyack he go.”</p>

<p>“What did he run away for?”</p>

<p>“Because he knows not what is good for
himself.”</p>

<p>“Well, if we meet the lad, we’ll tell him
where to find you,” laughed one of the boys.</p>

<p>“No, no—ma foi, no!” cried Pierre, in
alarm, as he made an emphatic gesticulation.
“No, no—make not like that!”</p>

<p>But his only answer was another loud burst
of laughter; and, singing a college refrain, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
boys resumed their march, while the chauffeur,
wishing that he had not spoken quite so
freely, started his machine again.</p>

<p>The road, however, did not approach the
river, and, fearing that the Colonel might return,
Pierre soon turned, and within a few minutes
was back at the starting point, again
staring at the dark line of woods.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a sound which made
him start to his feet with an exclamation of
alarm.</p>

<p>Over the still air, from the direction of the
river, came a faint call for help; and Pierre’s
nerves tingled with excitement, as he strained
his ears to catch a repetition.</p>

<p>“Ma foi! Monsieur the Colonel—I think
it ees his voice!” he cried aloud, in agitated
tones.</p>

<p>“Help!”</p>

<p>This time, Pierre was sure of it. With a
wild shout, he sprang to the ground and
dashed across the road, then headlong
through the thicket, his form soon disappearing
amidst the trees.</p>

<p>Like some huge monster guarding the highway,
the red touring car, now dusky and gray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
in the gloom, sent its acetylene glare streaming
over a silent and deserted road.</p>

<p>But it was not for long. George Clayton,
whistling merrily, accompanied by the others,
came along at a brisk pace.</p>

<p>“Hello!” cried George, as he espied the
car. “Wonder if anything’s the matter?
There’s no one in it. Looks like a good machine,
too; eh, Aleck?”</p>

<p>“A dandy; kind of funny to leave it standing
here. Maybe something’s busted, and
the choofer has gone off after tools.”</p>

<p>“Chauffeur, you mean,” corrected George.</p>

<p>“Sure—that’s what I said. He wouldn’t—what’s
the matter?”</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious! Also, did I ever
know the beat!” cried George, his voice
trembling with excitement. “Well, of all
things!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Matter enough; this is Uncle Dan’s, or,
rather, my car—my car; do you understand?—my
car.”</p>

<p>“Your car?”</p>

<p>“As sure as you live; and I might have
run right into Uncle Dan before I knew it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
Whew! Let’s skip, fellows. Gee whiz, what
a narrow escape! Who would have thought
of his being right here? I expected he’d be
coming along, too; yet—say—I’ll bet——”</p>

<p>“Bet what?”</p>

<p>“That Uncle Dan and Pierre have discovered
the house-boat.”</p>

<p>“And I guess you are right,” said Bob,
with a long breath. “Why else should they
have left the machine just here? This is
about where we came through the woods.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of meaner luck in your
life?” cried George, his eyes flashing with
anger. “I declare! I’m no two year old, to
be dragged back home; and I won’t be,
either.”</p>

<p>All the obstinate, combative spirit in
George’s nature was aroused, and, as he
pictured Pierre Dufour’s triumph, he paced
up and down and clenched his fists.</p>

<p>“But how could they tell that the ‘Gray
Gull’ was there?” murmured Tom. “You
can’t see the river.”</p>

<p>“It beats me,” answered George, in puzzled
tones. “Mighty lucky we stumbled across
the car, or else I should have walked right up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
and found Uncle Dan waiting to receive me
with open arms.”</p>

<p>“What’s to be done?” yawned Dave.</p>

<p>“Lie low. They’ll have to be pretty smart
to catch me. I haven’t done anything wrong—tried
my best to tell Uncle Dan about the
trip, and he cut me short. Then what did he
say about Jack Lyons’ father—‘A good
lawyer and useful citizen.’ Of course I
was surprised to find Redfern aboard; but
he’s a dandy chap, and I wouldn’t hurt his
feelings by backing out—no, sir.”</p>

<p>George spoke in a rapid, excited manner
which showed the disturbed condition of his
feelings, all the time keeping a watchful eye
open for any signs of his uncle and Pierre.</p>

<p>Suddenly, boyish voices, raised as though
an animated discussion was in progress,
reached their ears.</p>

<p>“Look out,” cautioned George.</p>

<p>“Just a lot of young chaps,” said Bob, reassuringly.</p>

<p>“I knew you were taking us about a mile
out of our way, Bill Stiles,” cried a voice.
“Felt it in my legs, I did. Hang the luck,
I’m so tired now, I can hardly move.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>“If you knew so much about it, why didn’t
you set us right, Roy Pinger?” demanded
another, loudly.</p>

<p>“Because Bill Stiles said he knew the way—that’s
why.”</p>

<p>“Say, why doesn’t the whole crowd jump
on me at once? If I hadn’t kept my eyes
open, you’d be strutting ahead now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jiminy! what a whopper, Bill Stiles.
Bet you don’t know anything about it. Hello—there’s
that chaffer fellow out here yet.”</p>

<p>“He must have nabbed the lad on ze boat-house;
and oh, how please monsieur the Colonel
will be! Oh, I say, chaffer, did you get
him?”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz, listen to that! They must
have been talking to Pierre!” exclaimed
George, turning excitedly toward the newcomers.
“Look here, you chaps,” he continued,
“what do you know about this?”</p>

<p>“Why, where’s the shoofur?” asked one.</p>

<p>“Has the show-fear skipped?” said another.
“Hello, you fellows—belong around
here?”</p>

<p>“No, we don’t,” answered George, shortly.
“You met the chap who runs this car, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>“Surest thing you know. Monsieur the
Colonel sent him after a lad who ran off on a
boat-house, and——”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say that he was
alone?” queried George, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Sure he was,” replied the other, apparently
surprised at the rich boy’s manner.</p>

<p>George Clayton whistled; and then, as if
feeling that it might not be wise to let the
others know too much, broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>“I suppose he’s over by the river, hunting
for the poor chap, eh?”</p>

<p>Bill Stiles looked at the rich boy earnestly.</p>

<p>“Bill,” he said, very calmly, “you know
something about this. The chaffer says,
‘Whiz; it is back to Nyack he go.’”</p>

<p>“The choofer said that, did he?” exclaimed
Aleck Hunt.</p>

<p>“Yes; that’s what the chaffer remarked,
Bill number two. Get your legs a-moving,
Roy Pinger.”</p>

<p>“Say, you’re kind of fresh, aren’t you?”
said George, quizzically.</p>

<p>“The salt of the earth are always fresh.
So-long, Bill! Whiz! Look out for monsieur
the chaffer—whiz—which way is it, Roy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
Pinger? Whiz—through the woods, eh?
All right—toddle,” and, laughing and jesting,
the party of students made across the road.</p>

<p>“Well,” exclaimed George, as he gazed
after their retreating forms, “did you ever
hear of such a piece of nerve in your life as
Pierre thinking he could come out here alone
and yank me back? Just think of it! I’m
surprised at Uncle Dan—ab-so-lute-ly astonished;
but I’m going to teach that nervy
chauffeur a jolly good lesson.”</p>

<p>“He needs it the worst way,” approved
Bob. “And the cheek of him, telling all
those chaps about you.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Fred
Winter, with interest. “Listen—is that any
one comin’?”</p>

<p>The boys strained their ears, but heard
nothing save a faint rustling caused by the
fitful breeze.</p>

<p>“Pierre Dufour has just a little bit of a
walk ahead of him,” went on George, speaking
rapidly. “This is my machine, bought
with my own coin; and if you chaps want a
dandy ride, jump in.”</p>

<p>“What?” gasped Fred Winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“That’s a bully idea,” laughed Aleck
Hunt. “I’ll go, all right. Know how to run
the machine?”</p>

<p>“I can start and stop it,” answered George;
“and talk a streak about carburetors, spark
plugs and steering gears; and if nothing
busts, and it stays face up, I’m all right.
Jump in. That silly chump may be nosing
back any minute—quick! Want to go,
Somers?”</p>

<p>Bob shook his head, and asked:</p>

<p>“How about the other boys?”</p>

<p>“We can leave the car in a garage somewhere
and look out for ’em. I’ll bet Pierre
is over by the house-boat now; and you
wouldn’t catch me falling into any trap.”</p>

<p>“You two fellows go,” said Fred, solemnly,
“and we’ll walk back. It’s going to be a fine
night to look at the moon, and——”</p>

<p>“That settles it,” laughed Aleck.</p>

<p>He jumped in beside George, who already
had his hand on the steering wheel.</p>

<p>“Sure you won’t take a ride, Dave?” asked
the millionaire boy, fairly bubbling over with
impatience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>“No, thanks; that nice chair in the house-boat
appeals to me.”</p>

<p>“You, Tommy?”</p>

<p>But Tom didn’t feel like going without the
others, and declined regretfully.</p>

<p>“Awfully sorry; but if you won’t accept
the treat that settles it,” said George, waving
his hand. “This will be a great joke on fiery
Pierre; and a good lesson besides. So-long!
What’s that? Sure—look out for the two of
us anywhere along the line. Bye, bye!”
And almost before the boys realized it the
big car was in motion.</p>

<p>By this time the moon was just above the
eastern horizon, and already its silvery radiance
was stealing over the landscape. The
sky was a deep gray blue, and not a cloud
dotted its surface.</p>

<p>The two boys in the auto saw the pale white
road extending off in an almost straight line;
back of them the distant hills rose dim and
ghostly against the sky, while over the broad
expanse of gently rolling country lights
sparkled in various farmhouses. Far above,
a night-hawk screamed its way in a circling
flight, and from the woods came the melancholy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
hoot of an owl. It was a scene that
awakened the admiration of both boys, and,
as the soft breeze fanned their cheeks, they
enjoyed it and the swift, gliding motion to
the full.</p>

<p>What George lacked in skill as a chauffeur
he made up in recklessness. Soon the fields
and the trees and the white road became a
confused blur. His eyes danced with excitement,
and he put on still greater speed. Faster—faster
raced the touring car, until Aleck
Hunt began to grow dizzy.</p>

<p>A bridge flashed by; then tall trees seemed
to spring up like warning sentinels on either
hand, and the road became a blotch of grim
shadows and silver lights.</p>

<p>By the side of a sycamore, whose spreading
foliage entirely hid the moon from view,
George slackened speed.</p>

<p>“Can go some, eh?” said the boy, breathlessly.</p>

<p>“You bet,” answered Aleck, a trifle bewildered.
“Gee whiz! Just like being in a cup
race.”</p>

<p>“And it isn’t anything to what it can do.”</p>

<p>“Perfectly stunning, anyway—dandy; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
if we went a bit slower, we’d see the scenery
better,” said Aleck, ingeniously.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted George. “Don’t I
wish I could catch a glimpse of Pierre’s face
when he finds the machine gone—ha, ha! I
can’t get over it. If Uncle Dan had been
along, I wouldn’t have done it—but——”
and George’s teeth shut together with a
snap.</p>

<p>The woods were soon passed, and a little
later, lights gleaming ahead and a soft, hazy
patch in the sky indicated that they were approaching
a town.</p>

<p>“Must be Newburgh,” remarked George.
“And say, this is such jolly good fun, I have
an idea.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Stop over night in the town, and early to-morrow
start for Poughkeepsie. Fred and
the Ramblers will tell the boys we’re all right,
eh?”</p>

<p>“It’s a great thought,” said Aleck, enthusiastically.
“A dandy time ahead of us—hooray!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I think, too,” laughed
George.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>“Now we’ll swing along gently, so that no
lynx-eyed constable will greet us with open
arms.”</p>

<p>Here and there a house was passed. Soon
they became more numerous, and, finally, the
car was pounding slowly along the streets of
Newburgh.</p>

<p>It was still early; the shops were brightly
lighted, and in the business section, quite a
crowd ebbed and flowed along the sidewalks.
The experience was a novel one to Aleck
Hunt, and he wondered at the ease and coolness
with which his companion steered the
big machine around wagons and out of the
way of electric cars.</p>

<p>“Oh, this isn’t the first time I’ve done it,”
laughed George, apparently divining his
thoughts. “Once or twice I have been in
pretty tight places, too. Look at that silly
chump turning in ahead of us. He never
stopped to see where he was going. That’s the
kind of thing which often takes up a couple
of inches’ space in the newspapers. Whoa,
boy! Just grazed his wheel. There’s a garage
over on the other side of the street, Aleck.
We might leave the machine; then for something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
to eat, and a nice room in the best hotel
in town.”</p>

<p>“All right,” grinned Aleck. “This is more
fun than looking at a few little specks o’ light.
Those other chaps certainly missed it.”</p>

<p>George quickly made arrangements to have
his machine housed at the garage, and, in a
few minutes, the boys were off searching for
a hotel.</p>

<p>One to their liking was found in the upper
part of the town, and they were soon enjoying
a good meal in ease and comfort.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE COLONEL SPEAKS HIS MIND</p>


<p>At the sound of Colonel Ellison’s familiar
voice Norman Redfern, whittling a piece of
wood in the cabin, sprang to his feet and
stepped out on deck.</p>

<p>The sudden appearance of the Colonel was
quite the greatest surprise he had experienced
in many a day; and when he saw a half
dozen boys, this was still another.</p>

<p>“See here, Redfern,” thundered Colonel
Ellison, with an emphatic wave of his arm,
“what do you think of yourself? Such a
miserable piece of conduct; such a downright,
underhanded scheme of paltry revenge
is beyond my comprehension. I could have
the law on you!”</p>

<p>“Why—what have I done?” stammered
Norman, altogether taken aback by the sudden
attack, and embarrassed by the snickers
of the students.</p>

<p>“What have you done—you have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
audacity to stand there and calmly ask me
that? Well——” the Colonel brought his
right fist down in the palm of his left hand
with a resounding smack, and glanced at the
group of boys, as if to say, “Just listen to
that.”</p>

<p>“He’s got his nerve with him, all right,”
said Bates, unable to conceal his pleasure.</p>

<p>If there was any row under way, Bates
could be depended upon to help it along.</p>

<p>“I will tell you, then,” stormed Colonel
Ellison. “When you found your whines and
wretched excuses were of no avail——”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Colonel Ellison, I made no
excuses,” interrupted Redfern, his face flushing.</p>

<p>“Now this is what I call a real interesting
conversation,” said Bates.</p>

<p>“What did you do?” went on the Colonel,
without heeding these interruptions. “You
induced my ward to join a gang of rascally,
irresponsible boys, who are idling away their
time in a miserable mud-scow. A fine thing
for a man of your age to be with such a
crowd.”</p>

<p>“Simply awful,” said Bates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“You are mistaken, Colonel Ellison,” said
Redfern, and there was a certain ring in the
ex-tutor’s voice which the Colonel had never
heard in it before.</p>

<p>“Do you have the effrontery to deny it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he will,” came from Bates. “He’s
tipping a wink to those chaps in back.”</p>

<p>Jack Lyons stepped forward.</p>

<p>“I know all about this affair,” he remarked,
calmly. “Redfern had nothing to
do with it. He tried to make George go
back home, and——”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard that voice before,” exclaimed
the angry Colonel. “Boy, where have I seen
you?”</p>

<p>The speaker gazed searchingly at Jack
Lyons, whose face was clearly revealed by
the moonlight, and almost instantly added,
“Why, you’re the very boy who was in my
house, and—didn’t I see you on the road just
a few minutes ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>

<p>“Ah! And you saw fit to change your
voice, eh? and actually had the impudence
to tell me you hadn’t even seen a house-boat?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>“Sad, very sad case,” observed Bates.</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, Colonel; I said I hadn’t
seen any rascally boys, and that’s the truth.”</p>

<p>“You are one of the young scamps yourself,”
thundered Colonel Ellison. “I suppose,
Redfern, you will even deny that George
was on the boat?”</p>

<p>“You ought to know me better than that,
sir.”</p>

<p>“He’s losing his nerve,” said Bates.</p>

<p>“Well, just understand, Redfern, that if I
ever catch you having anything more to do
with my nephew I shall seek redress through
the law. George will go back with me to-night,
and——”</p>

<p>“A mighty good thing for George, too,” remarked
the irresponsible Bates.</p>

<p>“I have given orders that you shall never
be allowed to enter my grounds again. Do
you understand me?”</p>

<p>“You have done me an injustice in one
case, and are repeating it in another.”</p>

<p>“Injustice? Fiddlesticks! You are a
cowardly, underhanded scoundrel. For all
I know, my ward may be hiding inside at
this very moment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>“Wouldn’t surprise me a bit, sir,” said
Bates. “I’d search the house from cellar to
garret.”</p>

<p>“Hey, you smart duck,” interposed Jack.
“You’re throwing your words around pretty
fast, now aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded Bates. His exasperating
grin grew broader; he stuffed his
hands in his pockets and said, “What’s that?”
again, in a much louder and shriller key; and,
as Jack made no response, continued, “Salt
water might take some of the freshness out of
you—this water is salt.”</p>

<p>“Is it?” said Jack.</p>

<p>“It is—to reverse your words,” returned
Bates.</p>

<p>“If you don’t stop that grin pretty soon,”
said Jack, solemnly, “it may get frozen on
your face.”</p>

<p>Bates opened his mouth to make a reply,
but Colonel Ellison interposed.</p>

<p>“Enough of this silly bantering,” he said,
sternly. “George!” he raised his voice—“if
you are in that boat, I command you to come
out!”</p>

<p>“Ah, the plot thickens,” said Bates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>“Redfern, bring that mud-scow further inshore,”
went on the Colonel, sharply.</p>

<p>“George is not on board; my word must be
sufficient.”</p>

<p>Colonel Ellison stared at the speaker in unconcealed
astonishment. He had felt a sort
of grim triumph in the thought of forcing the
mild-mannered young man to execute his
commands. But something of the spirit of
Jack Lyons seemed to have been aroused
within Norman Redfern, and he returned his
former employer’s gaze unflinchingly.</p>

<p>“You absolutely defy me, then?” cried the
Colonel, furiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s a sly one,” said Bates. “The
water’s deep enough here; you mustn’t let
him fool you, sir.”</p>

<p>“And he won’t. Once more, Redfern, will
you bring that boat close ashore?”</p>

<p>“You can come over in the dory.”</p>

<p>“A nice way to talk,” said Bates. “But
don’t get in a cranky little boat like that, sir.
Not one of us would think of risking it; you’d
be upset sure—hello! Didn’t I hear a sound
inside the boat—listen!”</p>

<p>Sure enough; something had evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
dropped to the floor; then came a repetition
of the sound.</p>

<p>“It’s as certain as you’re knee-high to a
grasshopper, there’s some one inside!” cried
Bates, excitedly.</p>

<p>He walked quickly past a tree to the edge
of the steep bank, stopping at a position which
afforded a good view into the brightly lighted
cabin.</p>

<p>“See anything?” queried one of the students.</p>

<p>“Kind of,” was the rather non-committal
response.</p>

<p>Colonel Ellison stepped hastily forward and
paused by the student’s side.</p>

<p>“Redfern,” he began, sternly, “I——”</p>

<p>Then, without warning, a curious thing
happened.</p>

<p>The bank suddenly began to slide away
beneath their combined weight. Bates gave a
wild cry of alarm, and scrambled to safety,
while Colonel Ellison, finding himself going
down amidst an avalanche of dirt, sticks and
stones, frantically threw his arms above his
head. His hands closed tightly over the tree’s
lowest branch, and the next instant the
doughty Colonel was suspended over the water,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
with the branch slowly dipping down beneath
his weight.</p>

<p>“Help!” he yelled, in an amazingly loud
voice, holding to his frail support with the
grip of despair.</p>

<p>“Good land!” cried Bates.</p>

<p>“Much needed,” said another.</p>

<p>“Help! Don’t stand around like a lot of
addlepates!” shouted the Colonel, furiously.</p>

<p>Several feet of the bank, splashing into the
water, had sent forth a succession of rollers.
The victim’s dangling legs could find no
support, and each instant, fearful that the
branch might break, Colonel Ellison could
only look at the dark, lapping water just
below and anticipate the dreadful moment
when he would be immersed.</p>

<p>It was certainly a strange spectacle in the
moonlight to see the usually dignified Colonel
dangling from the limb like a fish at the end
of a line; and when the first moment of surprise
and alarm had passed, several very
suspicious gurgles came from the students.</p>

<p>Jack Lyons was the first to take action.
The second tremendous blow from the Colonel’s
fog-horn voice had scarcely ceased echoing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
when, with a cheery, “Hang on tight,
sir,” he jumped into the dory, quickly untied
it, and paddled in Indian fashion toward the
victim, whose feet were now almost touching
the water.</p>

<p>“Hurry!” gasped Colonel Ellison, despairingly.
“I can’t hold on much longer.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir!”</p>

<p>The boat glided beneath his feet.</p>

<p>“Be careful,” said Jack. “Steady—don’t
let go till I say the word.”</p>

<p>He reached up, bore his weight upon the
limb, and the Colonel’s feet soon rested upon
the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>“Take your time, sir—easy now.”</p>

<p>But the Colonel was in too excited a frame
of mind to heed this advice, and only Jack’s
watchfulness and care prevented a catastrophe.</p>

<p>“Rest your hand on my shoulder, sir,” said
the boy. “I’ll steady her—look out!”</p>

<p>For an instant it looked as if the Colonel
would upset them both. Advice and suggestions
came in a steady stream from the
shore.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid, sir; if you fall in, we’ll
fish you out,” yelled Bates, encouragingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp52" id="p220" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p220.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">“HANG ON TIGHT, SIR”</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But Jack’s skilful efforts finally triumphed,
and Colonel Ellison was landed
safely on shore.</p>

<p>Perhaps never before had so many conflicting
emotions surged through his brain. He
was conscious that he had cut a very sorry
figure before the much despised tutor; and
the mirthful chuckles and grinning faces
which the moonlight disclosed added to his
feelings of wrath and mortification. He owed
a debt of gratitude to Jack Lyons, yet he could
not force his lips to frame the words which
he knew the boy deserved.</p>

<p>While in this very uncomfortable state of
mind, there was a crashing among the underbrush
some distance off, and the group saw
a slim figure dashing madly toward them.</p>

<p>“Pierre!” gasped Colonel Ellison.</p>

<p>The chauffeur, who seemed about to hurl
himself bodily upon the foremost, stopped
short, breathless and panting, and stared wild-eyed
at the group before him.</p>

<p>“Monsieur the Colonel, Monsieur le Colonel,
I had such fear,” he stammered. “Such
fear!” he placed his hand over his heart; “I
hear you cry, ‘Au secours!’ and I run, oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
how I run! Ah, I had such fear—but you
no hurt, eh?”</p>

<p>Pierre’s words came out in a series of jerks,
and he stood quite still, as if the shock yet
gripped his heart.</p>

<p>Bates whistled.</p>

<p>“Certainly I am not hurt, Pierre!” exclaimed
Colonel Ellison, his tone indicating
a great lack of appreciation for his chauffeur’s
solicitude.</p>

<p>“Ah, then I am content, monsieur the Colonel;
I had such fear—for why you——”</p>

<p>“You should never have left the automobile,
Pierre,” said the Colonel, hastily.</p>

<p>“But your voice; it came over ze air
like——”</p>

<p>“A steam whistle in distress.”</p>

<p>“And I say, ‘Ze Colonel, he must need
me.’”</p>

<p>“Horrible carelessness, anyhow,” said Bates.
“I’d give him a piece of my mind. But, if
you please, sir, don’t you think there’s some
one hiding inside that house-boat? You
heard a noise yourself. What’s that over
there?”</p>

<p>Norman Redfern was holding up a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
object which emitted several plaintive squeaks
and tried to wriggle out of his grasp.</p>

<p>“The pup was on the table, and knocked
off a couple of pieces of wood,” he explained.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Bates, sadly disappointed.</p>

<p>“Go right back, Pierre,” commanded Colonel
Ellison, with a frown. “Such a valuable
machine should never be left for an instant.”</p>

<p>“Of course it shouldn’t,” remarked Bates.</p>

<p>“Very good, monsieur the Colonel; I go,”
said Pierre, bowing. “Ah, but I had fear!
Ma foi, but I no understand why you——”</p>

<p>“That will do, Pierre—go!” thundered
Colonel Ellison; and the chauffeur turned
away sadly puzzled.</p>

<p>“When George returns,” remarked the
Colonel, grimly, “he will find me here.”</p>

<p>“And now,” said Bates, “this little party
is entirely composed of pleasant people. Let
us introduce each of us to the other; fellows,
step up. Don’t be afraid—light isn’t strong
enough to show your faces very well. Colonel—Ralph
Chickers, sometimes known as
‘Chickens’; Ben Drayton; Tom Allen—he’s
only done one sensible thing in his life—entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
Thornton Preparatory School; here’s
Sam Wilde, and, last and least, Ban Twining.”</p>

<p>“Like fun,” came from the owner of that
name.</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” said Bates.</p>

<p>Jack Lyons and Joe Preston entered into
the jolly spirit of the students; but Colonel
Ellison, like an avenging nemesis, kept aloof,
his tall, gaunt figure moving almost silently
up and down the bank, stopping only now
and then to listen intently to any suspicious
sounds which came from the woods.</p>

<p>Bates seemed astonished to learn that Norman
Redfern was a graduate of Ripley.</p>

<p>“H’m,” he sniffed. “I can tell by your
voice that you hate to admit it. Why, we’re
kind of looking after a lot of foolish Ripley
chaps now. Guess at this very minute they
must be doing the babes in the woods act.
What’s that?”</p>

<p>A voice came floating over the silent air;
its tone of anguish and utter despair made
them look at each other in alarm.</p>

<p>“Monsieur the Colonel, monsieur the Colonel,
it’s gone!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>“Gone!” cried Colonel Ellison, with a
start. “What does the man mean?”</p>

<p>“Looks like another circus coming,”
grinned Bates, in delight.</p>

<p>The crashing amidst the underbrush grew
louder, and Pierre presently emerged, waving
his arms even more furiously than before,
while his agonized spirit poured itself forth
in a series of wails.</p>

<p>“Monsieur the Colonel, he—it—has gone!”
he gasped. “Gone!”</p>

<p>“What?” roared the Colonel. “The machine
gone?—it can’t be possible!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I say, monsieur the Colonel.
I run both ways on ze road, but I nevaire see
him; it’s gone!” and Pierre wrung his hands
in despair.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha!” said Bates.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” cried Jack Lyons. “Come
ahead, fellows!”</p>

<p>“More excitement, eh?” chimed in Joe, as
he followed Jack.</p>

<p>Without a word, Colonel Ellison strode
toward the woods; his face wore a terrible
frown, and with one look he completely
silenced the unhappy chauffeur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>Jack Lyons and Joe Preston reached the
road with the students.</p>

<p>“Yep,” said Bates. “Not a sign of it. Oh,
what a row I feel coming.”</p>

<p>In a moment, Colonel Ellison and Pierre
burst out of the wood, the former almost
winded by his unusual exertions.</p>

<p>The pale moonlit road, as far as it could be
seen, was deserted. No sound but the lowing
of a cow away off in the distance broke the
silence.</p>

<p>“Gone!” cried the Colonel, in a terrible
voice.</p>

<p>“Gone!” echoed Pierre, weakly.</p>

<p>“You stupid jackanapes,” shouted Colonel
Ellison, now completely overcome with wrath.
“This is a pretty kettle of fish—a valuable
machine stolen, and we stranded here on a
lonely country road, miles from anywhere—a
fine muddle you’ve put us in! How dare
you look me in the face?”</p>

<p>“Oh, monsieur the Colonel.”</p>

<p>“Don’t moo-seer the Colonel me!” roared
the angry gentleman, beginning to pace excitedly
up and down.</p>

<p>“It’s terrible,” said Bates, after some moments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
had elapsed. “You’ll never see that
whizzer again. Fine autos can’t be plucked
from trees.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur the Colonel,” pleaded the unhappy
chauffeur, “I hear you cry, ‘au
secour’; and I say——”</p>

<p>“Silence!” thundered his master. “Redfern
is responsible for this. He shall——”</p>

<p>“What’s that noise?” interrupted Bates,
holding up his hand with the greatest assurance.
“Listen, sir! It sounds exactly as if
the house-boat was putting off. Hello; those
two chaps belonging to it have disappeared;
that settles it—they are giving you the slip.
Bet your ward is on the old pile of logs, after
all, and you’re jolly well left again, sir.”</p>

<p>A distinct, though faint pulsation had suddenly
started up.</p>

<p>“Come with us, sir,” yelled Bates, “and
we’ll chase ’em.”</p>

<p>“After the rascals!” roared Colonel Ellison.
“Very likely you are right.”</p>

<p>A group of shadowy figures were soon
struggling pell-mell through the woods, the
boys giving their school yells.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE WAR-CALL</p>


<p>“Well, I don’t know that I like this,”
murmured Fred Winter, glancing after the
fast-departing automobile. “Awful nervy of
those chaps to run off that way, eh, Somers?”</p>

<p>“I can’t blame George very much,” laughed
Bob. “Pierre seems in need of a good lesson.”</p>

<p>“And what a perfect night for a joy-ride,”
sighed Dave.</p>

<p>“Almost wish we’d gone along with ’em,”
added Tom. Then, as his ears suddenly
caught the sound of distant voices, he added:
“Let’s catch up with those cheeky prep-school
boys. Guess they know the way. Mighty
easy to get twisted up in this tangle.”</p>

<p>A network of fairy lights and shadows now
streaked the ground and tree trunks, and here
and there a rock shone strangely distinct.
Each moment new vistas of weird beauty
opened out before them.</p>

<p>“If there were any such things as woodland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
sprites this would be just the place for
’em,” said Fred, as he surveyed the scene.
“Ah, I see those chaps now.”</p>

<p>The group had come to a halt in a small
clearing, and the house-boat boys soon realized
that they were in no hurry to leave. Bill
Stiles and Roy Pinger were having another
animated discussion.</p>

<p>“Hello!” called Bob Somers.</p>

<p>Conversation stopped, and the boys, evidently
taken by surprise, awaited their approach.</p>

<p>“Why, say, you’re the chaps we saw on the
road,” remarked Stiles, as the four came up.
“Where are the other two Bills? There were
six of you, I thought. Whiz—is it to Nyack
they go? Did you see the chaffer?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” laughed Bob, “not yet.”</p>

<p>“I’m awfully glad that chap gave them the
slip; don’t blame him for keeping out of
sight for a while. Say, I’d like to see that
house-boat of yours.”</p>

<p>“We don’t even charge for looking at it.”</p>

<p>“Come ahead, Pinger; toddle,” said Bill
Stiles.</p>

<p>“My legs are too tired,” grumbled Roy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
seating himself on a stump. “Good thing
we got grub in that farmhouse about ten
miles back.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes Bob and his friends
learned that the names of the other students
were Grigsby, Cole, Dale and Andrews.</p>

<p>As they lolled around, the boys told him
about their annual motor boat trip, and how
on this occasion they had felt it their duty to
look after the “poor Thornton chaps.”</p>

<p>“You’ll see ’em,” remarked Bill Stiles,
“and meet a mighty cheeky fellow—Lon
Bates is his name. Ready to skip now, Pinger?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” answered Roy. “The charm of
this moonlit scene holds me in its spell.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t mind him,” said Stiles, with
a laugh. “He’s been bitten by the writing
bug, and practices on us; but his legs are
weak.”</p>

<p>Many minutes passed and the boys still
lingered, until a series of yells suddenly
brought them to their feet.</p>

<p>“Those Thornton chaps, as sure as you
live!” cried Roy Pinger, excitedly. “Listen!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>“Yelling again!” cried Stiles. “Wonder
if anything’s up? We’ll soon find out.”</p>

<p>The way Roy Pinger’s legs immediately
gained strength was quite remarkable. He
quickly took the lead, and the others crashed
after him, the shouts coming again serving to
guide them in the right direction.</p>

<p>It was a long, hard tug, and all the boys
were breathing heavily when they rushed
out on the shore. Some distance away, they
saw a group of shadowy figures surrounding
one of the motor boats.</p>

<p>Bob Somers uttered an exclamation, and so
did the others, for a single glance told them
that the “Gray Gull” was not at her moorings;
then, as a faint, but steady chug-chug
broke upon their ears, all looked out on the
river.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s another queer trick,” murmured
Dave, puffing hard. “Sugar! This is
a night of surprises, all right.”</p>

<p>But Bob Somers and the others were now
far in the lead, and all his breath and endurance
were needed to keep from being left
behind.</p>

<p>As the Ripley boys neared the others, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
uttered several yells, and the half-defiant calls
of the Thornton boys, like an echo, floated
back.</p>

<p>The party came to a halt just as the motor
boat was slowly forging out into the river.</p>

<p>“What’s up with you fellows?” yelled Lon
Bates, from the “Reindeer,” his tone indicating
great astonishment.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” called Ralph Chickers.
“Where did you chaps pick up that bunch?
Are you fellows doing a Marathon?”</p>

<p>But Stiles made no answer to these questions.
A peculiar light came into his eyes, as he
turned quickly toward Roy Pinger.</p>

<p>“There’s that chaffer in the boat, sure as
you live!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I see him,” said Roy.</p>

<p>“And that must be George Clayton’s guardian,”
chimed in Fred Winter, excitedly, as he
caught a glimpse of the Colonel’s military
figure in the bow.</p>

<p>“H’m; and we thought the chauffeur had
come alone,” murmured Bob.</p>

<p>“Hurry up!” cried Stiles. “The ‘Dart’s’ a
faster boat than theirs; we’ll find out what
those duffers are up to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>“You bet we will!” yelled Roy. “Quick,
you chaps!”</p>

<p>Sarcastic calls came from the Thornton
crowd as the “Reindeer” drew rapidly away.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, little boys,” came in Bates’
loud voice. “So sorry to leave you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you won’t leave us, even if we have a
big crowd aboard,” yelled Bill Stiles. “Don’t
worry.”</p>

<p>With a rush, the lads made for the “Dart,”
and Fred Winter, who was as excited as he
ever got to be, tumbled in last.</p>

<p>“Up with the anchor,” commanded Stiles,
tersely. “Fall all over yourself, Jim Dale,”
he added, as the latter, in an effort to be of
some assistance, tripped ingloriously.</p>

<p>“This is great sport, eh, my four Bills?”</p>

<p>Stiles gave the fly-wheel several quick revolutions;
the engine responded almost instantly,
and the “Dart” glided ahead. Soon,
under full power, it was hastening after the
“Reindeer.”</p>

<p>The moon shone from a cloudless sky, and
a thousand sparkling ripples shot from the
dark gray water. The distant shores were
lost in haze, while the line of woods close at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
hand stood out in patches of impenetrable
shadows and silvery lights.</p>

<p>With her throbbing engine sending forth
a steady stream of pulsations, the “Dart” cut
swiftly through the water. It was exhilarating
sport, and, as Bob Somers leaned back, he
thoroughly enjoyed the easy, gliding motion.</p>

<p>Far ahead, but a mere, uncertain patch of
dark with two tiny specks of light, was the
“Gray Gull.”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand it,” murmured Fred,
in perplexity. “Wonder why those chaps put
off; and what in the dickens George’s guardian
is chasing them for?”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon know,” laughed Bob.</p>

<p>The faces of the Ripley boys shone with excitement,
for this was a splendid opportunity
to have some fun with their rivals.</p>

<p>“Those foolish Thornton chaps have been
getting altogether too fresh lately,” commented
Bill Stiles. “To-night, the Ripley seniors
will teach ’em another lesson.”</p>

<p>“And one they won’t forget in a hurry,”
chimed in Roy Pinger, bubbling over with
glee. “Bates will think his old ‘Reindeer’
is moving backward.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>“That Colonel and the chaffer want to get
on your house-boat, my four Bills,” remarked
Stiles, presently. “And our job——”</p>

<p>“Is to show the Thornton chaps they can’t
put him there,” laughed Sam Grigsby.
“We’re gaining on ’em fast.”</p>

<p>“Only a few minutes more,” breathed Roy
Pinger. “Keep her a bit out, Stiles—that’s
it—steady! Remember, you chaps, that Ripley’s
reputation is at stake.”</p>

<p>“My eye! Don’t fear—we’re not going to
forget it,” grinned Harry Cole.</p>

<p>Steadily the swifter “Dart” gained on its
rival. Already the dark forms of the “Reindeer’s”
crew began to grow more distinct.</p>

<p>A loud, long and sarcastic call came over
the intervening space. Lon Bates had a tremendous
voice, and knew how to use it.</p>

<p>A rousing answer was immediately returned.
Then, with eager eyes, the boys watched the
space between the motor boats slowly lessening.</p>

<p>“We’re doing it now,” cried Bill Stiles,
gleefully. “Get ready, fellows.”</p>

<p>“I say,” put in Fred Winter, nervously,
“aren’t you chaps getting kind of reckless?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>“Wait and see, Bill number three,” said
Stiles, dryly.</p>

<p>“Can you swim?” asked Roy Pinger, with
a very wide grin.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Fred, “but I don’t want
to;” and he took off his glasses and looked
apprehensively at the choppy little waves
flowing swiftly by.</p>

<p>“Better get ready for anything,” counseled
Harry Cole.</p>

<p>“For the fun will begin in a few minutes,”
added Grigsby. “Sound the war-call, Andrews—won’t
be the first time they’ve heard
it.”</p>

<p>Owen Andrews, a tall, lanky lad, with a
shock of sandy hair sweeping across his forehead,
thrust his hand into a locker and drew
forth a very long tin horn.</p>

<p>“Signal number three,” he remarked, solemnly,
“meaning no quarter, eh, cap?”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” grinned Bill Stiles. “Let ’er go!”</p>

<p>Andrews placed the tin horn to his lips;
immediately there followed an ear-splitting
blast which fairly made Fred Winter jump to
his feet. He had never known that a tin
horn could be made to produce such a variety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
of unearthly sounds; and when Andrews,
quite red in the face from his exertions, took
it from his lips, he gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“Did yourself proud that time,” commented
Bill Stiles. “Finish it.”</p>

<p>And Andrews did. A perfect din again
floated over the air; and then the sounder of
war-calls sank back quite exhausted.</p>

<p>Before the last echoes had ceased, a series of
tremendous yells came from the Thorntons.
They rose in a crescendo and ended in a medley
of long-drawn-out groans.</p>

<p>“The correct answer to signal number
three,” remarked Stiles, with satisfaction.
“But say, aren’t those fellows getting cheeky,
though?”</p>

<p>The “Reindeer” was now rapidly approaching
the house-boat, which had stopped its engine;
and now the swift-flying “Dart” was
so close to its rival that the faces of the boys
could be clearly seen.</p>

<p>“Stop your engine!” commanded Stiles,
fiercely.</p>

<p>“Stop nothing!” yelled Lon Bates, defiantly.
“Keep off!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear what I said?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>“Yes! And this is our answer,” and again
the war-call of the Thorntons broke forth.</p>

<p>Stiles smiled grimly, but made no response.</p>

<p>Gradually the “Dart” drew abreast, and,
as the two motor boats raced side by side,
Colonel Ellison and his chauffeur looked on
in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Keep that boat away!” commanded the
former, half rising in his seat.</p>

<p>“Ma foi, yes; it is one grand risk,” chimed
in Pierre, with fear in his tone.</p>

<p>“Then make him stop his own engine!”
shouted Bill Stiles. And he actually changed
his course, so that the prow of the “Dart”
began to swing slowly in toward the “Reindeer.”</p>

<p>The utter abandon and recklessness of the
Ripley students brought forth a storm of
stern protests from the now really alarmed
Colonel.</p>

<p>“Look out!” he called; “you’ll be into us
in another moment—look out!”</p>

<p>But Bill Stiles paid no heed to this warning.
The “Gray Gull” was now but a short
distance away, and both boats were headed
directly toward it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>“What are you trying to do, you idiots?”
yelled Lon Bates, alarmed and angry.</p>

<p>“Swing around, if you don’t like it; quick,
now!”</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar!” groaned Fred Winter.
“These reckless chaps will have us all in the
water.”</p>

<p>“I insist—shut down your engine!” roared
the Colonel, and, with an angry gesture, he
reached over, as if to operate the lever himself.</p>

<p>Boiling over with anger, and seeing that his
rivals had all the advantage, the captain of
the “Reindeer” was forced to yield. The
pounding of the motor suddenly ceased; he
changed his course with an abruptness that
sent Colonel Ellison lurching back in his seat.</p>

<p>As he did so, the Ripley boys gave a tremendous
yell of triumph, and their war-call
again sounded over the Hudson.</p>

<p>Then the “Dart” shot swiftly across the
“Reindeer’s” bow.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">IN THE RED CAR</p>


<p>Bright and early on the following morning,
George Clayton and Aleck Hunt were
astir, and had their breakfast. Then they
strolled leisurely around the town, taking in
the sights.</p>

<p>Newburgh is charmingly situated, and has
many points of interest.</p>

<p>About half-past nine, the boys reached the
garage, took their places in the touring car,
and, in a moment, were out on the busy
street.</p>

<p>“Now for Poughkeepsie,” remarked George.
“Weather doesn’t look very promising—all
gray and cloudy.”</p>

<p>“And last night was such a dandy,” sighed
Aleck. “Say, we’re awfully careless.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Might have run plumb into that chauffeur.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t have bothered me in the least,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
said George, calmly. “I made up my mind
to see Poughkeepsie, and I’m going,” and
again he spoke in a tone which indicated
that he was accustomed to having his own
way.</p>

<p>“Automobiling is a jolly fine sport, isn’t
it?” said Aleck.</p>

<p>“Yes, when everything goes all right,”
laughed George. “But I’ve seen times when
I thought it pretty stupid.”</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>“Well—a busted tire; or something the
matter with the machinery, and nothing to
keep you company but a lot of rocks and
trees. Here’s the post-office; I’ll stop and
scribble a line to Uncle Dan.”</p>

<p>“And me for a postal card home,” said
Aleck.</p>

<p>The writing was done in a remarkably short
time, and the two were soon driving along the
principal street.</p>

<p>“I’m tired of dodging cars and wagons,”
said George, at length. “We’ll get out in the
country and put on a bit of speed.”</p>

<p>“But don’t go so fast we can’t get a look
at the scenery,” remarked Aleck, who seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
to have developed a wonderful fondness for
nature during the last few hours.</p>

<p>George looked at him quizzically, but made
no reply, and, within a short time, the red
touring car was flying swiftly through a
rather flat, open country dotted with farms.</p>

<p>The sky was dark and lowering; rain
threatened to fall at any instant, and, as the
morning progressed, a breeze sprang up and
the ominous look of nature increased.</p>

<p>“We’re going to catch it,” grumbled George.</p>

<p>“In for a ducking, sure enough,” said
Aleck. “It’s too bad.”</p>

<p>A few miles from Newburgh, a fine, steady
drizzle set in and blew in their faces, and not
being provided with goggles, the boys found
it very unpleasant.</p>

<p>Now and then, they passed a village, and
occasionally a farmer’s wagon rattled slowly by.</p>

<p>“This is one of the times when automobiling
is pretty dull sport,” sighed George.
“I wish now we were in the nice, comfortable
cabin of the ‘Gray Gull.’”</p>

<p>The drizzle gradually increased to a steady
rain. All nature was wet, and wore a dismal
aspect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>As the rain beat relentlessly upon them,
the boys’ spirits fell, and they lapsed into
silence, while the red touring car rolled off
mile after mile, passing farmhouses and
small villages, where the ever-present small
dog rushed out to bark and snarl and risk his
life in front of the gliding monster.</p>

<p>On long, straight stretches, George drove as
fast as he dared, and Aleck, who was getting
used to the sensation, made no protest, but,
wet and miserable, huddled back in an effort
to protect himself from the pelting rain.</p>

<p>“Well, I certainly am disgusted,” declared
George, at length. “I couldn’t be wetter—could
you?”</p>

<p>“Not if the river was to roll up and spill
all over me,” sighed Aleck, ruefully. “Nice
looking messes we are to go to Poughkeepsie.
What shall we do when we get there?”</p>

<p>“Leave the auto in a garage I know of;
then wait for the ‘Gray Gull.’ She ought to
be along by early evening.”</p>

<p>“Who’s going to take the auto back to
Nyack?”</p>

<p>“Pierre, or myself. Remember, Aleck, it’s
my machine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>Another hour passed, and George uttered a
sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Not much further, now,” he said. “See,
there’s the Great Poughkeepsie railroad
bridge.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz, it’s high and it’s long,” said
Aleck, with interest. “Looks pretty faint
through the rain, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and there’s a ferry-boat coming in.
We’ll be just in time to get across.”</p>

<p>The car glided upon the ferry-boat with
just an instant to spare and came to a stop
behind a farmer’s wagon.</p>

<p>Had the day been pleasant, the two boys
would have thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
Close by was the great railroad bridge,
behind them rose a line of picturesque hills,
and across the river lay Poughkeepsie, at the
present moment quite hidden by rain and
mist.</p>

<p>In a few moments, the ferry-boat was
under way. The wind had kicked up the
surface of the gray, gloomy river into whitecapped
waves, and the boys could not help
wondering how the “Gray Gull” was faring
amidst such a storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>Gradually the buildings of the town became
visible; then the ferry-boat entered her
slip, and the red touring car slowly followed
the farmer’s wagon into the street, and up the
hill.</p>

<p>Main Street is a wide, pleasant thoroughfare
lined on either side with good-sized
buildings, and, in spite of the stormy weather,
presented a busy appearance.</p>

<p>George kept to the side of the car track.</p>

<p>“Garage isn’t far,” he said. “And won’t I
be glad to get there? If Pierre knew about
our trip, he’d have the laugh on us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he would,” said Aleck, dismally.</p>

<p>“We’ll swing right around this corner,
and——”</p>

<p>“Better let the car back of us pass,” interrupted
Aleck.</p>

<p>George glanced over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“I’m too good a chauffeur to lose so much
time,” he laughed, as he turned the touring
car and started to cross the track.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll——”</p>

<p>He stopped short and uttered an exclamation.
With a suddenness that jarred both
boys, the automobile came to an abrupt halt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
and the car bearing down upon them was
prevented from crashing into it only by the
quick and timely efforts of the motorman.</p>

<p>“Hey there! What are you about?” he
yelled.</p>

<p>“Another pretty mess,” murmured George,
with a rather dismal expression. “I can’t
make it budge.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” cried Aleck.</p>

<p>“Come now, get out of that!” continued
the motorman, clanging his gong loudly.</p>

<p>George, without replying, continued his
efforts to send the automobile ahead; but it
stood across the track just as immovably as if
its wheels had never revolved.</p>

<p>A crowd of curious onlookers began to
collect.</p>

<p>“Get a horse!” shouted some one.</p>

<p>“Step out and push,” chimed in another.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know any better than to block
the cars?” said a third.</p>

<p>Suggestions and bantering remarks flew
thick and fast, while George, red in the face
and fuming, jumped out and began to examine
the machinery.</p>

<p>Another car rolled up; wagons began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
stop, and, in a few minutes, the embarrassed
boys began to think the whole population of
Poughkeepsie had assembled at that particular
point.</p>

<p>“Try an aeroplane next time, boys,” said a
tall, grave-looking man.</p>

<p>“Speak gently, and coax it,” laughed his
companion.</p>

<p>“We’re twenty minutes late now,” growled
the disgusted motorman, approaching.
“Things is comin’ to a pretty pass when
youngsters is allowed to run them things by
theirselves. Hurry up, bub. Hey, you in
the car, why don’t you get out of that, and
help your pard?”</p>

<p>“Fond of stayin’ out in de roin?” asked
an urchin.</p>

<p>“I’m twenty minutes late now, an’——”</p>

<p>“It’ll be forty soon,” said the boy, in great
glee.</p>

<p>“One—two—three cars back, and another
coming,” said the motorman. “If Bill Watson
was here, he’d make that thing go.”</p>

<p>Considerably flustered at the commotion,
George worked and perspired, but not being
an expert made no progress at all. With an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
obstinacy that defied all his efforts, the motor
refused to work, and Aleck, who had jumped
to the ground, looked at him in dismay.</p>

<p>“What’s to be done?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered the other,
blankly.</p>

<p>“Twenty-six and a half minutes late. I
ain’t goin’ to stand this no longer,” growled
the motorman.</p>

<p>“You ain’t standing it; the auto’s doing
that,” remarked some one.</p>

<p>In spite of the rain, a great crowd jostled
and surged around the stalled automobile.
Seven cars stretched back in a line, and five
wagons had stopped.</p>

<p>“Git your shoulders to the thing an’ push
it over to the side,” commanded the motorman.
“Never could see no sense in ’em, anyhow.
Git out from under there, bub—I’m
twenty-nine minutes late a’ready.”</p>

<p>“Make it thirty and be done with it,”
grumbled the disgusted George, red in the
face.</p>

<p>“No sass—I don’t take none.”</p>

<p>“Same here.”</p>

<p>“Jest listen at that, gents! He ain’t satisfied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
with tying up the whole car line; but
he hands out sass. Can you beat it?” and,
with a wave of his hand, the motorman appealed
to the crowd.</p>

<p>“Quit your row, now,” broke in George,
sharply.</p>

<p>“Me—makin’ a row? Well, did I ever
hear sich talk? Thirty-one an’ a half minutes
late! Any more of that sass comin’?”</p>

<p>“Do you think I stopped here on purpose?”</p>

<p>“Wal, you’ll git out on purpose. Now
I——”</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble here?” exclaimed an
authoritative voice.</p>

<p>A policeman pushed his way forward.
Then, as his eyes rested on the number of the
automobile, he uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Just the one we’re looking for,” he said,
eagerly. “Where are the fellows running it?”</p>

<p>“Right here,” said the motorman. “Cap,
I’m thirty-four minutes late, an’ that
there——”</p>

<p>“Hey! Nab those two chaps!” roared the
policeman, ducking around the car.</p>

<p>But George Clayton had quickly taken in
the situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>The hot blood mounted to his face, as he
thought of being actually detained, and he
determined to outwit the authorities, regardless
of his automobile and everything else.</p>

<p>With a hurried, “Come ahead, Aleck,” he
dashed headlong out of the crowd, and made for
a side street, while Aleck instantly followed.</p>

<p>The crowd seemed to melt, and the lusty
shouts of the policeman urged the boys on.</p>

<p>Thoroughly aroused, George and Aleck put
on a terrific burst of speed, and easily distanced
the foremost of their pursuers. They
were just as successful in dodging several who
tried to head them off.</p>

<p>Up one street and down another the boys
raced, with several street curs barking and
snapping at their heels.</p>

<p>When they came to a pause, it was by the
side of a lumber yard. The high piles served
as a protection from the rain, and the two,
breathing hard, leaned against the fence, and
looked anxiously for any signs of their pursuers.</p>

<p>“Some excitement, eh?” gasped George,
when he had recovered his breath sufficiently
to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>“I should say so,” panted Aleck, stuffing
his hands in his pockets. “Whew! Maybe
we haven’t had a time of it. But say, how
about your auto?”</p>

<p>“That part of it doesn’t bother me,” answered
George, with a calmness that surprised
his companion. “The authorities are bound
to take care of it. Gee whiz—it made my
blood boil when I thought of being held in
this place until Uncle Dan, or perhaps Pierre,
should straighten things out. Just think of
it.”</p>

<p>“I did think of it,” said Aleck. “That’s
the reason I ran so fast. Don’t believe we’re
safe in this place.”</p>

<p>“Nor I, either.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Look out for the ‘Gray Gull’; and make
Jack Lyons sail right away from Poughkeepsie.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have some hours to wait.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can go to some small restaurant
and get a bite to eat. Jiminy, I’d like to
know what they have done with the auto,”
and George laughed.</p>

<p>“Wonder what was the matter with it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t know, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“We’d better get along.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. And keep far away from
Main Street. Gee! My little trip has certainly
raised the dickens; and all on account
of Pierre Dufour’s stupidity.”</p>

<p>Slowly and cautiously the two walked to
the corner, and seeing nothing but a deserted
street, started briskly off, keeping a watchful
eye open for any signs of danger. Half an
hour later, they entered a small restaurant
near the river front, and enjoyed the best in
the house.</p>

<p>The meal and a long rest put them in better
spirits again, and when they walked outside
it was to see that the rain had stopped enough
to allow a patch of blue sky to show between
the slowly moving clouds.</p>

<p>“This is a bit better,” remarked George,
with satisfaction; “but I wish it had stopped
before it began. Where shall we go? Why,
down by the river, I guess. Your legs tired?
It’s a good thing you can’t feel mine—no
Marathons for me.”</p>

<p>The boys continued their walk, never going
very far from the river. On the outskirts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
the city, they came across an old man sitting
on a log, puffing contentedly away on a short
pipe. Close by his side was a shaggy dog.</p>

<p>The old fellow looked up as the two approached.
His face, bronzed a deep brown,
was seamed with wrinkles, but his eyes were
kindly and a smile curled his lips.</p>

<p>“Afternoon, youngsters,” he said, cheerfully.</p>

<p>“How are you?” replied George and Aleck,
almost in a breath.</p>

<p>“Fair to middlin’. Me name’s Bill Hollback.”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear it,” said George, politely.</p>

<p>“An’ me father’s name was Bill Hollback;
his father’s name was Bill Hollback; an’
hisn, too, was Bill Hollback. Kinder curious,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Very.”</p>

<p>“An’ that ain’t all; me son’s name is Bill
Hollback.”</p>

<p>“I hope they are all well and happy,” said
George.</p>

<p>“Hey?”</p>

<p>“That is—of course, I mean you and
young Bill.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes; fair to middlin’. This here dog’s
name is Sailor.”</p>

<p>“That’s a nice name.”</p>

<p>“Yes—fair to middlin’. That there skiff
ye see out there is mine; gived to me by the
finest man you ever see—lives over to Ticketwood
house.”</p>

<p>“A nice boat,” said Aleck. “The ‘Lottie,’
eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes—fair to middlin’ name. I’ve sailed
a bit in me life. What’s that—will I hire me
boat? Say that again, youngster—will I hire
me boat?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I asked,” said George, smilingly.
“Eh, Aleck, we’ll go back to meet the
‘Gray Gull.’ Say, why can’t we?”</p>

<p>“Suits me to a dot.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s start right off. Come on, Mr.
Hollback; we’ll have a jolly nice sail,” and
George walked over to the edge of a rickety
wharf.</p>

<p>Old Bill and his dog arose.</p>

<p>“You have spoke the cheerfulest words I’ve
hearn fur a long spell,” he said. “‘Will I
hire me boat?’ Them words don’t sound
nateral. Would ye mind sayin’ them again?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
and Old Bill chuckled mirthfully, as George
complied.</p>

<p>Old Bill Hollback was a good sailor and
knew how to get the benefit of all the breeze
that was stirring, and the “Lottie” was soon
standing out from the wharf.</p>

<p>Vivid patches of blue sky showed in many
places, and the sunlight streamed through the
openings. The afternoon and evening promised
to be delightful.</p>

<p>The “Lottie” was a speedy boat, and the
stiff breeze filled out her sail; and, now and
then, her bow, plunging into the whitecapped
waves, sent a sheet of spray flying over the
gunwale.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Old Bill, “I spent many a year
on the water; once made a voyage to China.
All the Hollbacks was sailors. Me father’s
name was Bill, and his father’s name——”</p>

<p>“Did you like China?” interrupted George,
hastily.</p>

<p>“Fair to middlin’. Somebody hailin’ us,
ain’t there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, over on that wharf.”</p>

<p>“We’ll p’int her in a bit, an’ see what he
wants.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>“Hello, Bill Hollback!” came a loud
voice. “Hello!”</p>

<p>“Me eyes ain’t so good; but I knows his
voice,” said Old Bill. “He belongs to the
perlice.”</p>

<p>George and Aleck exchanged swift glances.</p>

<p>“I’ve done bits o’ work fur ’im; onct
helped ’im run down a gang o’ river
thieves——”</p>

<p>“Hello, Bill Hollback!” yelled the man on
the wharf again. “Keep your eyes skinned
for a house-boat with a parcel of boys aboard.
It’s coming up the river.”</p>

<p>“Ye see,” chuckled Old Bill, “them perlice
needs me ag’in.”</p>

<p class="ph3">THE COLONEL IS ANGRY</p>


<p>“What do you mean by such conduct, you
young rascals?” thundered Colonel Ellison,
wrathfully.</p>

<p>Bill Stiles had manœuvred in such a manner
that the “Dart” now rested between the
“Reindeer” and house-boat.</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Bill, calmly, “those
Thornton chaps have been too fresh lately,
and we’re just showing them for about the
hundredth time that it doesn’t pay to buck
up against Ripley.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are, eh?” sneered Lon Bates.
“If it hadn’t been for this gentleman and his
choofer, I wouldn’t have given you an inch.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” chimed in Ralph Chickers,
no less disgusted than his chief.</p>

<p>“That will do from you, ‘Chickens,’” observed
Bill Stiles.</p>

<p>Colonel Ellison moved uneasily in his seat.</p>

<p>“I shall report your utterly reckless and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
disgraceful conduct to the school authorities,”
he went on. “You narrowly escaped upsetting
us. Such a lot of children should never
be entrusted with a motor boat.”</p>

<p>“Quite correct, sir,” said Lon Bates.</p>

<p>“And I demand that you immediately
stand out of our way, as I wish to be put
aboard that house-boat. Redfern,” he shouted,
“is my nephew there?”</p>

<p>“No, Colonel Ellison, he is not.”</p>

<p>“I intend to see for myself.”</p>

<p>“You are quite welcome to do so.”</p>

<p>“Get out of our way, Bill Stiles,” commanded
Lon Bates. “You heard what this
gentleman said.”</p>

<p>“My ears are good, Bates. Colonel, we
shall run up alongside; and if you will kindly
step into our boat, you shall be transferred in
something less than a minute.”</p>

<p>“Not on your life!” cried Bates, indignantly.</p>

<p>“The idea,” said Tom Allen.</p>

<p>“Stop your wrangling, boys,” exclaimed
the exasperated Colonel. “I can’t stay out
here all night.”</p>

<p>Norman Redfern interposed.</p>

<p>“See here, fellows,” he said, addressing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
Ripleys, “I’m a graduate of Ripley. I ask
that you withdraw, as a favor to me.”</p>

<p>This remark caused an immense sensation.</p>

<p>Owen Andrews picked up the tin horn, and
blew another tremendous blast, and a salvo of
cheers arose on the air.</p>

<p>“That’s the way we always salute our graduates,”
said Bill Stiles, when the frantic din
had subsided.</p>

<p>“Being skipper of a log hut is doing pretty
well for a graduate of Ripley,” said Bates.</p>

<p>This remark caused a hearty burst of laughter,
in which Redfern joined.</p>

<p>“Ma foi—he speaks well,” exclaimed Pierre.
“But, oh, how much of it we hear. Is it
all night that we have ze grand talk?”</p>

<p>“Apparently so,” said Colonel Ellison, with
a faint touch of amusement in his voice.</p>

<p>“Ripley has won another victory,” remarked
Bill Stiles, “and is satisfied. We are the ultra-personification
of grandiloquent magnanimity.”</p>

<p>A faint “oh” came from Pierre; then
silence fell upon the scene, only to be broken
a moment later by the sound of the “Dart’s”
engine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>“Look alive, Bill on the house-boat,” went
on Stiles, addressing Jack Lyons. “Catch this
line.”</p>

<p>He threw it; then stopped his motor, and,
with considerable skill, navigated the “Dart”
so that she swung easily up to the “Gray Gull.”</p>

<p>Jack Lyons and Joe Preston uttered exclamations
as Bob Somers, who had been
seated far back, rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“Where in the dickens did all you fellows
come from, old boy?” began Jack.</p>

<p>Bob gave a warning gesture.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you in a few minutes. Much
obliged, you Ripley chaps. We’ve had a
lively race.”</p>

<p>“Why, where in the world is George? And
where’s Aleck?” burst out Joe.</p>

<p>“Sh-h-h! Wait a minute,” whispered Bob,
who had now jumped aboard the house-boat.
“Can’t talk for a minute—here comes his
guardian.”</p>

<p>The “Reindeer” presently landed its distinguished
passenger. Colonel Ellison stepped
forward and favored the former tutor with a
tremendous frown.</p>

<p>“Redfern,” he said, sternly, “what is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
meaning of this? What business had you to
run away?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t,” interposed Jack Lyons, calmly.</p>

<p>“Explain yourself, young man.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was this way,” said Jack. “Won’t
you have a seat, sir?”</p>

<p>“No!” said Colonel Ellison, sharply.</p>

<p>“I took the ‘Gray Gull’ out myself.”</p>

<p>“Thought the river was free; the air is,”
said Joe, cheerfully.</p>

<p>“You attempted to run away. Answer me—did
you not expect to pick up my ward and
have him continue with you, in spite of my
express wish to the contrary?”</p>

<p>“No, sir—not exactly.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Let me explain, Colonel,” interposed Redfern,
with a slight flush.</p>

<p>“I’m talking to this young man.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said Jack, calmly, “the honest
fact is I wanted to see George before he ran
into you; and——”</p>

<p>“What?” cried Colonel Ellison.</p>

<p>“And I knew that if he saw the ‘Gray
Gull’ out on the river he’d suspect something
and keep out of sight. You see——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>“I never listened to such impudence in
my life,” stormed the angry Colonel. “You
heard that, Norman Redfern?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my, oh, my!” gulped Joe.</p>

<p>“Sh-sh,” said Fred; “be more polite.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t heard quite all, Colonel,”
interrupted Redfern.</p>

<p>“Oh, there is more to come, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” went on Jack, calmly facing the
angry gentleman.</p>

<p>“Tickets to the show, ten cents,” came from
the irrepressible Bates; “three for a quarter.
Children admitted free.”</p>

<p>“It’s an honest fact—we were going to try
and make George return home; but we
thought he ought to have a chance, and not
be dragged back for that silly chauffeur to
have the laugh on him.”</p>

<p>“George is a high-spirited boy,” said Redfern;
“but we hoped to appeal to his reason.”</p>

<p>“And head off a fierce row,” added Bates.
“Say, what wouldn’t have happened in the
word-throwing line?”</p>

<p>“So you have constituted yourselves into a
committee, as it were, to decide questions between
myself and my ward? Very well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
Redfern; I wish you to understand one thing—let
my ward alone, or I shall place the
matter in the hands of the authorities.”</p>

<p>Turning abruptly, Colonel Ellison hailed
the Thornton students.</p>

<p>“Young gentlemen,” he said, “will you
kindly put me ashore?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” answered Lon Bates. “Start
the engine, ‘Chickens,’—only about five
thumps. That will do. Hang on to the post
there, until the gentleman gets in.”</p>

<p>When Colonel Ellison was seated safely, he
turned toward the boys from Ripley.</p>

<p>“Young men,” he said, “your conduct will
be reported to the proper authorities.”</p>

<p>But when, a moment later, the “Reindeer”
was set in motion, the “Dart” immediately
followed.</p>

<p>A chorus of cheery “good-nights” floated
over the air, and the house-boat was again
alone.</p>

<p>“Talk about a racket,” laughed Jack, as
they watched the rapidly receding boats. “It
was pretty lively, eh? Now, Bob Somers,
what’s all this mystery? Where are Aleck
and George?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>Bob Somers’ story produced a great sensation.</p>

<p>Jack whistled and thrust his hands deep in
his pockets, and whistled again, while Joe
burst out laughing.</p>

<p>Redfern looked very grave indeed.</p>

<p>“Things are getting worse and worse,” he
said. “Bob, don’t you think you should have
told all this to Colonel Ellison?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t care to act in too great a rush,”
answered Bob, calmly. “It’s easy to see that
George’s guardian is in a very unreasonable
frame of mind.”</p>

<p>“We can’t figure out what he is going to
do,” returned Redfern. “He may continue;
or go back; or notify the authorities. It is
only right that we should make an effort to
let him know the facts at once.”</p>

<p>“Small chance to catch him, unless he
lands at the nearest point,” observed Dave.</p>

<p>“Maybe the painful way in which the
automobile disappeared will take the pair
kiting back to the spot where it was last
seen,” said Joe, with a tremendous grin.</p>

<p>“We’ll head for that section of the earth,”
said Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>Under full power, the “Gray Gull” was soon
forging ahead. The changing position of the
tiny specks of light in the distance indicated
that the motor boats were still in motion, but
their course did not seem to be toward the shore.</p>

<p>“Say, Jack,” remarked Fred, solemnly, a
few moments later, “if you were so anxious
George shouldn’t run into his guardian, why
didn’t one of you wait somewhere on the road
for him, or in the woods?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t tell from what direction George
might come. Besides, we thought the Colonel
wouldn’t hang around any longer if the
house-boat pulled out.”</p>

<p>“Big surprise when those two launches began
scooting after us,” chimed in Joe.</p>

<p>Dave raised the telescope and swept the
surface of the river.</p>

<p>“Still on the move, and going right up
stream,” he declared.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” asked Redfern, with a
frown.</p>

<p>“Yes; no doubt of it. Take a look if you like.”</p>

<p>“Never mind; I’ll accept your statement as
a fact. But we’d better continue the chase until
we can no longer trace their movements.”</p>

<p class="ph3">GEORGE IS WANTED</p>


<p>“Well, this is a nice state of affairs, isn’t
it?” whispered George, when he had recovered
sufficiently from his astonishment to speak.
“Looks as if we had jumped from the frying-pan
into the fire.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” remarked Old Bill, “I’ve done
lots of work fur them perlice. Ye see, I
always hang out on the river—can’t get
away from the smell o’ the water. All
the Hollbacks was sailors. Me father’s name
was——”</p>

<p>“You told us before,” said George, hastily.</p>

<p>“So I did. Wal, I’ve done fair to middlin’,
an’——”</p>

<p>“Going to watch out for this house-boat?”
asked George, carelessly.</p>

<p>“Sure as me father’s name was Bill Hollback.
It ain’t nuthin’ to me what they’s
done. The perlice says to Bill Hollback,
‘Look out fur a house-boat,’ an’ I says to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
perlice, ‘There she be,’ leastwise if they don’t
up an’ skip afore the perlice git here.”</p>

<p>The water-front of Poughkeepsie presented
a variety of picturesque and interesting
sights. The “Lottie” sailed under the railroad
bridge, and the boys greatly admired the
immense structure. Then they went by the
ferry slips, where one of the boats was just
swinging out, and finally Old Bill headed out
toward a slim, white-hulled yacht anchored
near the opposite shore.</p>

<p>“Belongs to a New York feller,” he explained.
“I know the cap’n.”</p>

<p>When the “Lottie” had sailed across the
river, and circled around the handsome yacht,
George declined an invitation from the good-natured
mate to “step aboard,” and the skiff
began her return voyage.</p>

<p>George was indeed sorry that their prospective
trip to meet the house-boat had been so
unexpectedly cut short.</p>

<p>“Bill,” he said, as they stood on the wharf
and he handed the old sailor a two-dollar
note, “does this pay you?”</p>

<p>“All fur me?” queried the other, arching
his eyebrows in surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>“Every cent.”</p>

<p>“Wal, as sure as me father’s name was Bill
Hollback and hisn was too, I’m surprised.
Youngsters, I’m a friend of yourn fur life.”</p>

<p>“Good,” laughed George. “Now, Bill, I’m
kind of curious about that house-boat—I’d
like to know something about it. May we
see you to-night?”</p>

<p>“You certainly kin. I lives near the
wharf; an’ will sartingly be proud to hev ye
come,” and Old Bill named a street and told
the boys how to reach it.</p>

<p>It was about half-past six when the two set
out in search of Old Bill’s house. They easily
found the street. It was a narrow, winding
thoroughfare with rickety dwellings and large
storehouses. The surroundings seemed to suggest
water, and boats, and Bill Hollbacks.</p>

<p>Crushed between two larger buildings was
the old riverman’s home; and the two found
both himself and Bill Junior waiting to receive
them.</p>

<p>“Come right in, youngsters,” he said,
heartily. “You’re as welcome as the flowers
in May. Fetch chairs, you Bill—that’s it.”</p>

<p>George and Aleck looked about them with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
interest. The old-fashioned, dingy room and
old-fashioned furniture seemed so apart from
the present age that they would not have been
surprised to learn that the long line of Bill
Hollbacks, from the dim and misty past to
the present, had spent their lives within its
walls.</p>

<p>“Wal, youngsters, I ain’t got much to tell
ye,” said Old Bill, reflectively.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you see that house-boat, after
all?” asked George, carelessly.</p>

<p>“Sartingly did; and with me own eyes. A
crowd o’ lively chaps aboard, too. But it
didn’t do no good.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Wal, some youngster they was lookin’ fur
weren’t there.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Aleck, also in a very indifferent
tone.</p>

<p>Old Bill’s quaint and original views were
so entertaining that the boys stayed much
longer than they had intended.</p>

<p>Suddenly a loud, peremptory knock on the
door startled them.</p>

<p>“Must be Dexter,” said Old Bill. “He’s
the man what called to me from the wharf<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
this afternoon. Drops in ’most every night fur
a cup of coffee, Dexter does. Open the door,
lad.”</p>

<p>A tall, thin man entered. He had an
aquiline nose, keen gray eyes, and an air of
authority.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bill,” he said, familiarly. “Company—don’t
often happen, eh? Sit still,
lads. How’s the world treating you, Bill?”</p>

<p>“Fair to middlin’. These youngsters was
out with me this arternoon in the ‘Lottie.’
They was kinder curious about that there
house-boat, and dropped in to ask about it.”</p>

<p>Dexter fixed his keen, gray eyes on George
Clayton’s face, and a rather peculiar expression
flashed across his own. He leaned forward,
and the boy noted, with sudden apprehension,
that the look he received was more
than one of idle curiosity.</p>

<p>“Brown hair, blue eyes, straight features,
gray suit, soft hat.”</p>

<p>Dexter, checking off this enumeration on
his fingers, paused, and smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“Stop—stop!” he yelled, an instant later.</p>

<p>George had been thinking quickly, and was
already on his feet. Springing forward, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
overturned his chair, reached the front door,
and flung it wide open. Aleck was scarcely
a yard behind him.</p>

<p>“Stop—stop!” commanded Dexter, again.</p>

<p>But his words fell upon deaf ears. The
two boys pounded along the pavement, which
was almost deserted, and were soon around a
corner.</p>

<p>Bill Junior was on their trail. Bill was
long of limb and fleet of foot. The pursuing
Dexter was soon left far behind; but Bill
Junior kept close at their heels, unshakable
as their own shadows.</p>

<p>“Stop, you fellows, stop!” he panted.
“Stop—I want to speak with ye.”</p>

<p>Looking over his shoulder, George saw how
near their pursuer was. He gritted his teeth;
his breath was almost spent; one more desperate
effort, and he was obliged to halt.</p>

<p>Panting, George Clayton backed up against
a high fence. It was a deserted locality.
Close by, a lone gas lamp cast a pale, flickering
glare on a row of posters; across the way
was a line of tenements, deep in shadow; beyond,
were fields. It seemed on the edge of
nowhere—a dismal, forbidding place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>Aleck stopped close by. For several moments,
none of the three boys spoke. A
variety of feelings coursed through George
Clayton’s breast. He looked at Bill Junior’s
strong, loosely-put-together frame, his big,
bony hands; and gazed at the grinning face
with its tousled hair, and then—</p>

<p>Bill Junior extended his hand.</p>

<p>“You’re a couple o’ smart ones,” he cried.
“My, oh, my! An’ pop talkin’ the way he
did! Ha, ha—I can’t get over it—ha, ha!”
and Bill Junior, having recovered his breath,
immediately lost it again in a paroxysm of
mirth. “Oh, my, oh, my, but ain’t I glad that
old Dexter got left! It’s the richest thing out;
an’ pop talkin’ the way he did! Ha, ha!”</p>

<p>“And you mean,” gasped George, scarcely
believing his ears, “that you didn’t come
after us to——”</p>

<p>“I’m awful tickled that ye got away—that’s
what!” cried Bill Junior, heartily; “an’ I
come after ye to tell ye. Ha, ha, but won’t I
jist laugh at pop an’ old Dexter? Shake—ye’re
a couple o’ smart ones.”</p>

<p>“Bill,” remarked George Clayton, with a
sigh of relief, “you’re a regular brick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>“I should say so,” chimed in Aleck. “Gee,
but if I had only known before I broke the
quarter mile record. Do you think Dexter
will look for us?”</p>

<p>“Sure! That fellow would spend a week
lookin’ fur an alley cat, if it got away from
him,” said Bill Junior, forcibly.</p>

<p>“Then,” said George, with some alarm,
“we’d better get along.”</p>

<p>“I know whar’ the house-boat is, an’ I’m
goin’ to tell them fellers to watch out fur ye.”</p>

<p>The three held a brief consultation, and
Bill gave them a bit of advice which the boys
agreed to accept.</p>

<p>“Well,” said George, with a long breath, as
Bill’s figure disappeared around a corner,
“did you ever hear of anything to beat it?
To think of running right into the very fellow
who was looking for me.”</p>

<p>The two soon reached the river front. The
great bridge and hills rising on the opposite
shore formed a pleasing picture; but the
street close at hand, with its pools of water
and dismal surroundings, did not.</p>

<p>They struck off briskly, and soon were leaving
the city behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>In about half an hour, they saw a lone,
frame house standing back from the road.</p>

<p>“This must be the deserted building that
Bill Junior told us about,” remarked George,
with a laugh. “Nice place for a millionaire
boy to spend the night.”</p>

<p>The house, with its gabled ends and peaked
roof, wore a mysterious air in the moonlight.
Over its pillared door vines grew in profusion
and thick masses climbed across the front of
the house.</p>

<p>There was no door to impede their progress.
In spite of himself, Aleck found creepy feelings
stealing over him. But it would never
do to back out now. With a cheery whistle,
he stepped boldly into the hall, then
through a doorway, to find himself in a large
room.</p>

<p>But he had no sooner set foot inside than a
series of strange sounds suddenly started up,
and, with an exclamation of alarm, he stepped
back.</p>

<p>Before Aleck could make another move, an
object struck him violently on the back of the
head, sending him against the wall.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">TWO NIGHTS</p>


<p>For an instant, Aleck Hunt was too terrified
to move. The weird sound of flapping
wings filled the room. A black object flashed
close to his head; then another, and Aleck,
with a stifled cry, dodged hastily through the
doorway, and collided with George Clayton.</p>

<p>“Good gracious! What’s the matter?”
gasped the latter, in alarm.</p>

<p>“Bats,” answered Aleck, laconically.</p>

<p>George peered cautiously in.</p>

<p>“Jiminy, the room is full of them!” he
cried. “Never saw so many in my life.”</p>

<p>“I got an awful crack on the head,” said
Aleck, ruefully. “Nearly knocked me over.”</p>

<p>“Moral: never go into a perfectly dark and
deserted place without looking,” laughed
George.</p>

<p>The moonlight streaming through the
broken panes revealed a number of the creatures
wildly circling around and around,
sometimes skimming close to the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>“Look out!” yelled Aleck, suddenly.</p>

<p>One of the bats veered sharply, flew through
the doorway directly over their heads, and
disappeared into the next room. Another
followed its lead, and the boys hastily moved
away.</p>

<p>“Regular Batville,” remarked Aleck, rubbing
his head. “And Bill Junior said it was
just the place for us to spend the night.”</p>

<p>“Don’t suppose he ever saw these tenants,”
laughed George. “What shall we do now?”</p>

<p>“Take a look up-stairs.”</p>

<p>This time, the other boy offered no objection,
and, with Aleck in the lead, they started
up. The rickety steps creaked and groaned
dismally beneath their feet, and a cloud of
dust arose. It was dark in the passageway
and both moved with great caution, each instant
expecting to hear the sound of flapping
wings above their heads.</p>

<p>But the upper rooms were deserted, and the
two breathed a sigh of relief as they entered
the largest, their footsteps echoing strangely
throughout the house.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Aleck.</p>

<p>“Well,” said George.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>They looked at each other and laughed.</p>

<p>“Roughing it with a vengeance,” said
George, walking toward the window. “A bit
more than I bargained for; still, I guess we’ll
have to stand it.”</p>

<p>“Just what we don’t want to do,” said
Aleck, with a grin. “If we only had some
straw, and a blanket, and——”</p>

<p>“Why not say a feather bed, nice, clean
sheets, wash-stand and electric lights?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” laughed Aleck. “What we
can’t get, there’s no use kicking about, eh?
Philosophy with a big P, old boy.”</p>

<p>Using their coats as pillows, the boys finally
lay down.</p>

<p>It was a long, uncomfortable night, and
never had they so welcomed the glimmer of
early dawn. When George arose and looked
out of the window, he saw in the eastern sky
a line of purplish clouds edged underneath
with a rosy glow, but all else was gray and
cheerless.</p>

<p>“Aleck!” he called. “Wake up! I declare,
how can that chap sleep so well?”</p>

<p>The other aroused with a start.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he cried. “Oh, my, but I’m sore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
and stiff,” and, as he arose, Aleck groaned
and grumbled, and rubbed his aching bones.</p>

<p>“So am I,” said George, cheerfully. “But
let’s be off. We’ll have breakfast at some
farmhouse, and then for the ‘Gray Gull’
again.”</p>

<p>The day promised to be warm. As the sun
rose higher and higher and the birds caroled
and chirped, and squirrels scrambled frantically
to places of safety and peered down with
their bright, beady eyes, the boys forgot their
pains and aches, in the enjoyment of nature.</p>

<p>A good-hearted farmer gave the two a ride,
and, on turning off at a fork, told them where
a meal could be had.</p>

<p>The people at the farmhouse welcomed
them heartily, and the boys enjoyed a bountiful
repast with some of the “men folks.”</p>

<p>An hour later, Aleck and George were lying
in the shade of some fine old willows, watching
eagerly for the house-boat.</p>

<p>The heat gradually increased; scarcely a
breath of air seemed stirring.</p>

<p>Another hour passed, and George, who was
lazily fanning his face with his handkerchief,
started up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>“Hello, I’ll bet the ‘Gray Gull’ is coming,”
he said. “See it?”</p>

<p>“Believe you’re right,” said Aleck, gleefully.
“Won’t I be glad to see those chaps
again?”</p>

<p>Eagerly, the two watched the dark spot
gradually growing larger. It seemed to the
boys as if the “Gray Gull” had never moved
so slowly. Impatiently they ran along the
beach toward it, giving several lusty yells and
waving their arms.</p>

<p>“Hello, hello!” came faintly over the air,
in Jack Lyons’ familiar voice.</p>

<p>Aleck put his fingers to his lips and whistled
shrilly, while George shouted again.</p>

<p>The figures on the boat began to assume definite
shape; then she was headed inshore. Enthusiastic
greetings flew back and forth over
the water, as though the boys had not seen
each other for a month; and the boat had
scarcely come to a stop before Jack Lyons
leaped to the shore.</p>

<p>“Hello, Jack! Hello, Bob Somers!”</p>

<p>“Hello, George!”</p>

<p>“There’s Aleck!”</p>

<p>For several moments, questions flew from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
one to another, with bewildering rapidity, and
George Clayton presently heard a piece of
news which made him whistle and open his
eyes wide with astonishment.</p>

<p>“What!” he gasped, scarcely believing his
ears, “you saw Uncle Dan—he was on that
automobile? Jehoshophat! Well, well!” and
George thrust his hands deep in his pockets
and whistled again.</p>

<p>“Big surprise, eh?” laughed Bob Somers.</p>

<p>“Surprise?” echoed George. “Surprise is
no name for it. Whew! I don’t wonder he
was angry. Sailed into you, Norman—of
course?”</p>

<p>“It was an unfortunate combination of
circumstances that led you to run away with
the machine,” said Redfern. “I am sorry
you were so thoughtless.”</p>

<p>George studied the ground an instant before
replying.</p>

<p>“So am I, Norman,” he said, frankly.
“But it can’t be helped now.”</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake, tell us about that
chase,” interrupted Aleck. “Must have had
an exciting time, all right.”</p>

<p>Jack Lyons quickly gratified his curiosity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
and both listeners smiled broadly at the
recital.</p>

<p>“Those school chaps are still having lively
times, aren’t they?” said George. “Mighty
glad the Ripleys won out. I certainly should
like to know where the other crowd landed
Uncle Dan.”</p>

<p>“Maybe ‘Pouf’ wasn’t wild,” said Joe;
“ha, ha!”</p>

<p>The rich boy soon completed his tale, and
many “oh’s” and “ah’s” escaped from the
lips of his deeply interested listeners.</p>

<p>“Yes, we saw the two Bill Hollbacks—father
and son,” laughed Jack. “Great fellows,
eh?”</p>

<p>Then, in a few words, he told how the
“Gray Gull” had been visited by the authorities
in response to a telegram sent by Colonel
Ellison.</p>

<p>“And I know well enough that it was
watched all night,” he went on, with a laugh.
“But Bill Hollback Junior managed to tell
us your plans—a regular brick—that fellow.
So you slept in a deserted house, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we did,” and Aleck rubbed the back
of his head, reflectively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>Redfern again tried to induce his former
pupil to return home.</p>

<p>But George shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, Redfern,” he said, quietly, “I won’t
give that silly Pierre the least satisfaction.
Unless Captain Jack puts me ashore, and it
would be a mighty big scrap while it lasted,
I’m going to keep on.”</p>

<p>“I give it up, then,” said Redfern, with a
sigh.</p>

<p>“If a fleet o’ war vessels doesn’t come after
us before I get started, I’ll put that remark in
my history,” said Joe. “It will have to be a
work in two volumes, quarto size, illustrated
from life and otherwise by old Cap Lyons.”</p>

<p>“How I wish you’d begin. I do like to
read funny things,” remarked Fred, with a
very solemn face.</p>

<p>“It will be full of wit and pathos, also
ginger, kind sir,” said Joe.</p>

<p>Jack kept the “Gray Gull” about fifty
yards from shore. The atmosphere seemed
to quiver with heat. The landscape was
bathed in a yellow light, and the glare in the
water was hard to look upon.</p>

<p>Jack tied the steering gear, and they retired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
within, each taking a turn at the window
to see that the way was clear.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, the heat increased,
the faint breeze entirely disappeared, and not
a cloud spotted the sky.</p>

<p>Poor Confuse-us lay panting in a corner,
gazing pitifully from one to another, scarcely
able to enjoy his customary nap.</p>

<p>And so the day passed, and night came on.</p>

<p>Close inshore, the boys were attacked by
an army of mosquitoes and flies, and, Joe declared,
by every species of insect that ever existed.
They swarmed around the lanterns,
and filled the interior, and buzzed around their
heads, and the more they fought and slapped
the worse the marauders seemed to become.</p>

<p>“Awful,” said George. “Let’s go straight
across the river. We never could get a look
at the stars over here.” And this piece of advice
was acted upon.</p>

<p>The boys found conditions much better on
the other side. No sooner was the “Gray
Gull” anchored than Fred brought out the
telescope and stand. The former tutor’s
handiwork was much admired. The three
legs were fastened by means of hinges to an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
upright piece of wood supporting another that
turned horizontally; to the latter was fastened
a V-shaped trough capable of a vertical motion,
and in this the telescope was secured by
means of a strap.</p>

<p>The boys spent an enjoyable evening, studying
the stars, even Joe becoming quite enthusiastic
as he took his turn at the glass.</p>

<p>Aleck and George were very tired; so they
decided to retire rather early. All were good
sleepers, and before long quietness reigned in
the house-boat.</p>

<p>Bob Somers dreamed that Confuse-us, grown
into a great big dog, had seized the fly-wheel
in his teeth and set the engine in motion.
And the pulsation had a strangely double
sound; and he vaguely puzzled over it in his
sleep, and seemed to hear the water gurgling
against the side of the boat.</p>

<p>Finally Bob awoke with a start, sat bolt upright,
and uttered an exclamation of wonder.</p>

<p>The dream was only half a dream. The
“Gray Gull’s” engine was silent; but the
strange sound of double pulsations reached
his ears plainly; and the boat actually seemed
to be in motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>“Gracious goodness! What does this
mean?” he murmured.</p>

<p>Then, still scarcely believing that he heard
aright, he jumped up hastily.</p>

<p>Yes, there was no doubt about it now.</p>

<p>With a loud, “Wake up, fellows!” Bob
Somers was at the door.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">A MIDNIGHT TOW</p>


<p>Bob’s yell and the sound of the opening
door caused the utmost confusion. Jack,
half-awakened, almost fell out of his bunk;
Dave Brandon and Tommy were up in an
instant, while the others scrambled to a standing
position almost in unison. Then, their
senses taking in the extraordinary situation,
all followed Bob, Joe stumbling over the
terrified Confuse-us and going down on hands
and knees.</p>

<p>The “Gray Gull,” without any effort on its
own part, was cutting through the water at a
speed which it had never before attained.</p>

<p>Jack Lyons and Bob had disappeared
around the side of the boat.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” exclaimed the latter. “Did
you ever! The Ripley and Thornton boys
again—and—and towing us to beat the
band!”</p>

<p>A terrific din suddenly filled the air; above
the shrill blasts from a horn rose a chorus of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
loud yells. It was quite the most inharmonious
combination of sounds they had ever
heard, and Owen Andrews and his tin horn,
as a sound producer, were voted an enormous
success.</p>

<p>The “Reindeer” and “Dart” could be
plainly seen in the moonlight. The house-boat
boys, having groped their way around
to the front of the boat, responded to the
others’ shouts with loud cheers.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">Poor Ripley. Rah, rah—boom!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After about two seconds of silence, the
Ripleys were heard voicing a refrain that ran
as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And they’ll know there’s been a muss,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they’ll try to make a fuss;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But you’ll never hear of Thornton any more.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The rival students sang these lines with
the greatest gusto, Owen Andrews and his tin
horn again taking a prominent part.</p>

<p>Bill Stiles yelled to Lon Bates, and, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
a moment, the “Reindeer” and “Dart” had
come to a stop. Then the two skippers
brought their boats alongside the “Gray
Gull.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Lon Bates, “guess you fellows
had a frightful scare, all right.”</p>

<p>“Scare?” answered Jack. “Scare?—what
does that word mean?”</p>

<p>“I see,” chuckled Bates, “you are just as
chipper as ever.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; it doesn’t wear off,” laughed
Jack.</p>

<p>“You’re mighty good sleepers,” went on
Bates. “Never even heard us pull up the
anchor, and didn’t awake till we’d towed you
about five miles.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you boys are going back now,
and are ready for a winter’s grind?” said
Redfern.</p>

<p>“Right—about the first part,” said Roy
Pinger. “Just now, we’re showing these
Thornton chaps the way home. They might
stray off the river.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed Lon Bates. “They
keep close to us because they’re afraid of the
dark. We feel so sorry for ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How we wonder what’s the matter</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When those children make a clatter!</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Do you hear them tremble?” inquired
Owen Andrews.</p>

<p>“Want to know how to get the best of
them?” shouted Joe.</p>

<p>“We have a hundred rules for it, but you
may add one more.”</p>

<p>“Stay up all night and bail out the river.”</p>

<p>“At last we have met some one who knows
how to talk sense,” exclaimed Bill Stiles,
amidst a ripple of laughter. “It’s me for the
shore now, and a bit of sleep.”</p>

<p>And this sentiment met with unanimous
approval.</p>

<p>So Jack Lyons anchored the “Gray Gull”
once more, while the “Reindeer” and “Dart”
slowly moved toward the shore.</p>

<p>The house-boat boys lay down again, and
when they awoke in the morning their midnight
visitors had gone.</p>

<p>The heat was somewhat less oppressive, and
a pleasant air rippled the water.</p>

<p>About noon they caught a glimpse of the
Catskill Mountains to the west, a faint gray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
line against a pile of whitish clouds. But
the telescope brought this wooded range into
closer view and the charm and beauty of the
scenery appealed to all.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon, the “Gray Gull”
was approaching a section of the river in
which there are a number of islands. As
they slowly continued along, some of these
were found to be small, wooded hills, while
others were flat and marshy.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” remarked Jack Lyons, “let’s
camp out to-night for a change.”</p>

<p>“Select your island, cap,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“That one with rocks and trees suits me.
Plenty of shade—just the place for a camp.”</p>

<p>“And must be a lot of nice plants to study,”
added Dave. “Let’s go there by all means.”</p>

<p>To this sentiment Fred Winter heartily
agreed.</p>

<p>The house-boat was soon anchored in the
shade of the island, its pleasant wooded
heights rising above them. One by one they
scrambled ashore and began to explore it with
interest.</p>

<p>In portions it was rocky and barren, while
in others masses of underbrush grew in a wild<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
tangle which effectually prevented their passage.</p>

<p>But the boys quickly found a way to the
top, although in some places they risked a fall
over the steep, rocky ledges.</p>

<p>Bob Somers climbed a tree, and, perched
comfortably among the branches, had a good
view of the landscape. When he came down,
the eight, for Redfern had stayed by the shore,
took seats on a grassy knoll on the other side
of the island, and idly watched one of the
powerful Albany steamers passing on its way
to that city.</p>

<p>After supper a fire was kindled, and, as the
boys piled on brush and the flames mounted
higher and higher, they cast a bright glow on
the sturdy form of the “Gray Gull” and far
out over the dark water. Confuse-us, too,
joined the circle, and seemed quite mystified
and uneasy.</p>

<p>A steady breeze made the tree tops rustle
with a soft, musical whispering. The woods
outside the flaring glare looked black and forbidding.
The New York boys were surprised
to find how far the firelight carried. An island
some distance off sprang into view against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
the blackness, its rocks and trees weirdly illuminated.</p>

<p>That night the boys rested on beds made
of fragrant cedar boughs, and although the
insects were quite annoying, managed to sleep
most of the time.</p>

<p>Bright and early next morning the voyage
was resumed.</p>

<p>Had they so desired, Albany might have
been reached late that night. But Jack and his
chums decided to halt and wait for daylight.</p>

<p>“Besides,” said Tom, “we might give the
whole city an awful scare if we took ’em unaware
in the night.”</p>

<p>Once more, at dusk, the “Gray Gull” was
anchored near shore. An uneventful night
was passed, and about 9 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> on the following
day the “Gray Gull,” Jack Lyons,
master, had actually reached its destination—the
city of Albany.</p>

<p>The capital of New York State is built on a
succession of hills, and in the clear, bright
sunlight presented a beautiful sight. The imposing
capitol building loomed up prominently,
and several other handsome edifices
were pointed out by Redfern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>“Bet the governor is looking at us through
a spy-glass right now,” said Joe.</p>

<p>Boats of all description crowded the water-front.
There were saucy little skiffs, excursion
steamers, and clumsy barges, some of them
just in from their long trip through the Erie
Canal. Puffing, panting tugs were going up
and down the river. It was a picturesque and
lively scene, and the boys crowding the deck
of the house-boat gazed at the sights with
much enjoyment.</p>

<p>All of Jack Lyons’ faculties were on the
alert. Out in mid-stream, he was obliged to
navigate with the greatest care, and often the
“Gray Gull” wobbled violently on the swells
sent forth by passing boats.</p>

<p>Norman Redfern looked rather grave. His
trip on the house-boat had only placed him in a
worse light than ever in Colonel Ellison’s eyes;
and now that the journey was about over, and
he thought of leaving the jolly company of boys,
he could not shake off a feeling of sadness.</p>

<p>“It’s fine around here,” remarked Tom
Clifton, his eyes sparkling with pleasure.</p>

<p>“There’s a good place to tie up,” declared
Bob Somers, presently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span></p>

<p>He pointed toward an old pier close at
hand.</p>

<p>Quite a crowd collected, as the “Gray Gull”
swung slowly in. A boy with a fishing pole
kindly seized the rope that Jack Lyons threw
him, and wrapped it around a post.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes, the house-boat boys
were ashore. Jack answered questions from
the curious in his usual free and easy manner;
then all began moving away from the wharf.</p>

<p>“I certainly feel pleased,” declared George
Clayton, with a sigh of satisfaction. “Got to
Albany, in spite of Pierre; and now I don’t
care if Uncle Dan orders me right back home.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you won out, old boy,” said Bob,
slapping him on the back. “And—— Good
gracious alive!”</p>

<p>From behind a small shanty, a slight figure
suddenly stepped into view and confronted
the runaway.</p>

<p>One glance into the excited face that looked
into his own, and George Clayton gave a start.</p>

<p>“Pierre Dufour!” he exclaimed, in astonishment.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE PUSH-BALL CONTEST</p>


<p>“Ah, ha, Monsieur George, I would speak
with you von leetle minute!” exclaimed the
chauffeur, in a voice that trembled. “Ah, you
have not know what you do—ma foi. No!
Monsieur the Colonel, he—— Saire, I speak
not to you,” and Pierre’s black eyes flashed
with anger, as Norman Redfern stepped forward.</p>

<p>“Keep cool, ‘Pouf,’” said Joe, with a grin.
“It pays.”</p>

<p>“Von leetle minute, Monsieur George. I
stay here last night; I stay here this morning;
and ma foi, you come! You leave these
scamps now—you——”</p>

<p>“Cut it out, Pierre,” broke in George, with
an amused glance at the others. “Is my
uncle in town?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur George—at a hotel. You
come?”</p>

<p>“Better go,” counseled Redfern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>“Saire, you say nothing to him. I call
you von scamp. I no afraid of you. In la
belle France, I would my glove throw in
your face—so!” And Pierre waved his arm
threateningly.</p>

<p>“Cool off,” advised Joe.</p>

<p>“Listen, Pierre”—George spoke in an
emphatic tone—“you have made a mess
of things by your stupid meddling. Not
another word. We’re all of us going to see
Uncle Dan right now.”</p>

<p>George abruptly turned on his heel, and
started off in the direction of the hotel, while
Pierre, with a look of amazement, promptly
fell in the rear of the little group.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the hotel they found
that Colonel Ellison was out.</p>

<p>“Let’s go over to Ripley Academy,” proposed
George, paying no heed to the chauffeur’s
earnest efforts to attract his attention.</p>

<p>“That’s my idea,” agreed Jack.</p>

<p>“Take my advice, and wait for your uncle,”
said Norman.</p>

<p>“No use, when I can see him to-night,”
answered George, with a shake of his head.
“I’m going.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>“Wait—wait,” pleaded Pierre Dufour.
“Monsieur the Colonel, he say——”</p>

<p>But George pushed promptly by, and, in a
moment, was on the street.</p>

<p>Redfern and George both knew the city
well, and soon they were standing before the
capitol. It is a very massive building of
handsome design.</p>

<p>Joe’s proposition to go in and see the governor
was promptly vetoed.</p>

<p>“Don’t see why not,” grumbled Joe. “He
has to go to New York once in a while, and
might like to take the trip with us.”</p>

<p>Up one street and down another they went,
admiring the neat houses surrounded by pretty
lawns and the rows of substantial dwellings;
then back to the business section, where Jack
sent off a dozen picture postals to little Bobby.</p>

<p>After lunch, it was decided to visit Ripley
Academy at once.</p>

<p>Norman Redfern explained that the schools
were separated by only half a mile, and that
Ripley, the nearer, was about a mile from
town.</p>

<p>The day was pleasant, with a sky full of
flying clouds, the country charming, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
boys, in spite of the thought of meeting the
fiery Colonel, were in high spirits.</p>

<p>Ripley was an older institution than its
rival. The building was a plain, almost austere
structure, with a columned entrance and
a portico from which the Hudson was seen
between stately elms.</p>

<p>The building occupied by Thornton Preparatory
School was of a graceful modern design,
from the polished knob on the front door to
the high, battlemented tower.</p>

<p>Almost midway between the schools was a
level field. And it was on this that many
exciting contests for athletic supremacy took
place.</p>

<p>When the boys arrived on the Ripley campus,
they found it occupied by a lively crowd
of students. An air of excitement prevailed;
evidently some event of great importance was
about to take place. Groups had collected;
songs were being sung; and most of these referred
to the unfortunate Thorntons.</p>

<p>“Well, well—my gracious! All the Bills
together!” cried a hearty voice.</p>

<p>Bill Stiles, his face flushed with excitement,
rushed forward, shook each of their hands in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
turn, slapped “Bill number three,” otherwise
Fred Winter, on the back, and called loudly
for Roy Pinger.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! You’re just in time,” cried
the latter. “There’s going to be something
doing. Poor Thornton—don’t laugh too hard
at ’em. Come on, Bill; it’s time to skip.”
And the two Ripley seniors were off.</p>

<p>“Hello, what are you chaps going to do?”
yelled Bob.</p>

<p>“Follow us, and see,” answered Bill.</p>

<p>Crowds of students were now leaving the
grounds, and the nine followed in the rear.
As they walked along a wide, shady road,
glimpses of the river and hills beyond were
here and there seen.</p>

<p>The Ripley students continued to sing their
lively songs, varying the performance by occasional
yells and blasts from Andrews’ tin
horn. And it was not long before other
sounds, which they recognized as coming
from the Thorntons, reached their ears.</p>

<p>When the boys arrived at the athletic field,
a great crowd had assembled. In the center
was a huge, leather-covered ball.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” said Jack. “A push ball.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span></p>

<p>“And a Jim-dandy, too; must be six feet
high,” put in Aleck Hunt. “Now I see the
scheme. Great, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“This must be something new,” laughed
Redfern. “There goes a signal—probably the
first. They are lining up now—listen to Lon
Bates.”</p>

<p>“You could hear his voice a mile off,” said
Bob. “Wonder where the goal lines are.
Ought to be a nice, lively tussle. Wish to
goodness we were in it, eh, Redfern?”</p>

<p>But the latter shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not in my line, Bob,” he answered, dryly.</p>

<p>The boys surveyed the rival groups
with interest. The motor boat crews were
apparently the leaders in their respective
schools, and each had a crowd of sturdy followers
anxious for the fray.</p>

<p>“All ready, you chaps?” sang out Bates.</p>

<p>“Ready, here!” shouted the Ripleys, in
chorus.</p>

<p>The referee raised his megaphone.</p>

<p>“One—two”—it was a tense moment—“three—go!”</p>

<p>“They’re at it,” breathed Jack. “Yell for
the Ripleys, fellows!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>The two groups brought up against the
huge push ball at the same instant. It wobbled
and shook, and ambled sideways, while
defiant shouts were hurled from camp to
camp.</p>

<p>It was a battle full of interest and humor.
The erratic movements of the ball, which was
sometimes raised high off the ground, brought
forth peals of laughter.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Thorntons made a combined
onslaught, and the ball was pushed several
yards toward the Ripley line.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing back of it,” yelled Bates.</p>

<p>“Oh, my, but this is easy!” cried Ralph
Chickers. “Once more!”</p>

<p>“We’ll run ’em right through their own
front door!” shouted another.</p>

<p>But the Ripleys hurled themselves against
the sphere, pushed, struggled and panted, a
compact mass of determined lads.</p>

<p>Lon Bates, in his eagerness, stumbled, and
the huge ball rose awkwardly over his prostrate
form, amidst a storm of laughter from
the onlookers.</p>

<p>“Shove it sideways, Bill Stiles,” yelled Bob
Somers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span></p>

<p>“Strategy versus strength,” remarked Dave
Brandon. “Great Scott!”</p>

<p>The Ripleys had followed Bob’s advice with
a suddenness that took their opponents literally
off their feet. Before the Thorntons could
recover themselves, the Ripleys had carried
the ball five yards to the side, then pushed it
forward and regained all they had lost.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” yelled Jack. “Keep it up,
Ripley!”</p>

<p>Cheers, shouts, blasts from the tin horn and
megaphone raised a terrific din, and while the
excitement was at its height, George Clayton
touched Bob Somers lightly on the arm.</p>

<p>“See who’s coming,” he said.</p>

<p>Bob turned quickly, murmured, “Well,
well,” and nudged Norman Redfern.</p>

<p>In a moment, all were staring at two figures
rapidly approaching. One was Colonel Ellison,
and close by his side trotted his faithful
chauffeur.</p>

<p>“Think how this affair must look to your
guardian,” observed Redfern, with an air of
great regret.</p>

</figure>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed Joe. “The storm’s
coming. Hello! Those Ripley chaps are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
gaining again. Hi, hi! Push it right over
’em! Flatten out the whole crowd, you fellows!”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Joe Preston,” remonstrated Fred
Winter. “The Colonel will have a fine
opinion of you.”</p>

<p>Colonel Ellison had never appeared more
dignified and stern. His brow was wrinkled;
and he glared over the rim of his glasses at
his ward and nephew in a truly terrible manner.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, young man!” he began; “so I
see you at last, eh? What have you to say
for yourself?”</p>

<p>“Plenty, Uncle Dan,” answered George,
calmly and in a respectful manner. “But I
would prefer to talk somewhere else, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ma foi, what sang froid,” murmured
Pierre.</p>

<p>“Norman Redfern,” exclaimed the Colonel,
paying no heed to the attention his appearance
and words attracted, “you and I must
have an accounting. You deliberately defied
me. Through you, my nephew’s name has
appeared in the papers as a scapegrace. Your
misguided influence has made him recklessly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
disregard my wishes and actually defy the
authorities; and yet you still seek to——”</p>

<p>“Stop, Colonel Ellison!” interrupted Redfern.
His look of embarrassment was succeeded
by a flush of anger; his voice trembled,
but not from nervousness. “Stop—you are
going too far.”</p>

<p>“Sir?” thundered Colonel Ellison.</p>

<p>“Ma foi, ma foi! I hope it is not the fight
that has come,” muttered Pierre.</p>

<p>“You must hear me,” went on Redfern,
resolutely. “I shall stand no further accusations.
George Clayton,” he added, turning
toward the rich boy, “did I ever influence
you——”</p>

<p>“Look out—look out!”</p>

<p>So absorbed had the participants in this
conversation become that they failed to notice
how events were going on the battle-field.</p>

<p>Up to this time, neither side had gained any
especial advantage; but Thornton, by clever
strategy, suddenly sent the ball off at an
angle. The crowd melted away, but the
Colonel and Redfern heard the warning cry
too late.</p>

<p>A mass of struggling boys bore furiously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
down upon them, and Uncle Dan, taken altogether
by surprise, toppled unceremoniously
over, while the lighter Redfern sprawled full
length on the sward.</p>

<p>“The young scamps—the——”</p>

<p>But the remainder of the Colonel’s sentence
was lost in a roar of sound. A wave of
shouts had arisen; the boy with the megaphone
used it with the utmost abandon; and
Owen Andrews again succeeded in proving
the superior nature of his treasured tin horn.</p>

<p>In the general excitement, the Colonel’s
mishap had attracted but little attention.
Bob Somers and the astounded chauffeur
jumped to his assistance, but were waved unceremoniously
aside.</p>

<p>When the others again looked around, they
saw Colonel Ellison standing erect, his tall
form towering above Redfern, who had also
regained his feet. Close to him stood the excited
Pierre and George Clayton.</p>

<p>The latter seemed more interested in the
finish of the game than anything else, and
the boys didn’t wonder at it. They saw immediately
that the Colonel and Redfern had
not been hurt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span></p>

<p>It was a moment of the utmost confusion,
and the Ripleys, quick as a flash, saw their
advantage. The push ball, like a thing of
life, whirled off at right angles, then forward
again. Ralph Chickers slipped, and several
other Thornton lads fell over him.</p>

<p>With an irresistible rush, the Ripleys once
more hurled themselves upon the ball.</p>

<p>The Thorntons fought desperately, but the
attempt was as useless as trying to stop the
tides. Lon Bates frantically commanded and
stormed, only to find that his followers could
not be rallied.</p>

<p>Fifteen feet from the goal—ten.</p>

<p>With their eyes fixed on the white line,
the Ripleys, inspired by that spirit of determination
and aggressiveness which victory
almost won carries with it, continued the
battle. Only five feet now separated them
from the coveted goal.</p>

<p>In a voice that was strong and clear, Bill
Stiles commanded:</p>

<p>“All together—Ripley forever!”</p>

<p>And the others chimed in loudly:</p>

<p>“Ripley forever—now all together!”</p>

<p>Before an irresistible rush, the discouraged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
Thorntons fell back, and the big ball rolled
over the line.</p>

<p>As the cheers from Ripley and their adherents
rang out, a flag was run up on the pole
at the end of the field, and, as it fluttered out
on the breeze, “Ripley,” in big blue letters,
appeared on the silken surface.</p>

<p>The house-boat boys yelled loud and long.</p>

<p>“That old rag will come down yet,” grumbled
the disconsolate Bates. “I can tell you
that!”</p>

<p>Just at this juncture, and quite unnoticed,
a slight man of dignified bearing briskly approached.</p>

<p>As his eyes lighted on the ex-tutor, he
rushed with outstretched arms toward him.</p>

<p>“Norman Redfern!” he exclaimed, in a
tone of surprise and pleasure.</p>

<p class="ph3">GOOD NEWS FOR REDFERN</p>


<p>Redfern turned sharply.</p>

<p>“Mosley!” he cried, seizing the other’s
hand, and shaking it warmly. “I was intending
to stop in and see you. This is indeed
a pleasure.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been searching a month for you,
Redfern; but excuse me a moment—are you
Colonel Ellison, sir? I was out when you
called, but was told I might find you here.”</p>

<p>“That is my name, sir,” said Uncle Dan.
“You are the president of Ripley Academy,
I believe?”</p>

<p>Redfern seemed astounded.</p>

<p>“What!” he cried. “Mosley, is it possible?
Where is Professor Blackwell?”</p>

<p>“Resigned three months ago. And I was
elected in his place. Congratulate me, old
man!”</p>

<p>“With all my heart; this is splendid news.”
And Redfern again seized the other’s hand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
“Mosley and I were classmates here at Ripley,”
he added, to the others.</p>

<p>“Let me add my congratulations, too,”
said Colonel Ellison, stiffly, “and express the
hope that the majority of visitors will not be
obliged to come, as I have, with complaints
against the actions of your students.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the new president, “what is it? I
am sorry if they have misbehaved themselves.”</p>

<p>“Some effort should be made to prevent
such occurrences in the future.”</p>

<p>“What is the nature of your complaint?
But perhaps we had better withdraw to another
place,” added the president, noting that
his visitor spoke in a tone which carried a
long distance.</p>

<p>As they walked slowly along the road,
President Mosley listened intently to Colonel
Ellison’s complaint against Bill Stiles and his
motor boat crew, and promised to look into
the matter thoroughly.</p>

<p>“And now,” he said, “if you will permit
me, Colonel, we will change the subject. I
was on the point of communicating with you
on a matter of the utmost importance, both to
yourself and Norman Redfern.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>“Eh?” said the Colonel.</p>

<p>“What is that, Mosley?” asked Redfern,
quickly.</p>

<p>“As I told you, I have been hunting for
you for a month, but could find no trace of
your whereabouts. All letters addressed to
you were returned. Where in the world did
you stop?”</p>

<p>“At a place where postmen never come,”
replied Norman, with a faint smile. “But
what has happened—why should you wish to
see me so particularly? To speak frankly, I
know that Professor Blackwell expressed a
wish that I should keep away.”</p>

<p>“I must remind you, Redfern, that the
wishes of President Blackwell are not those of
President Mosley.”</p>

<p>“Good for you,” put in Joe Preston.</p>

<p>“What does all this rigmarole mean?” demanded
Colonel Ellison, looking from one to
the other, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Simply this: by a bit of detective work,
an unfortunate situation has been cleared up—the
name of a certain person entirely freed
from blame, and——”</p>

<p>“What is that?” cried Redfern, his voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
trembling with excitement and hope. “You
mean——”</p>

<p>“Just what I say. But, as it is a private
matter, I would respectfully ask that these
young gentlemen retire for a short time.”</p>

<p>“Not so far as I am concerned,” put in
Redfern, with a flush. “I have nothing to
conceal; speak freely.”</p>

<p>“Something great coming, I’m sure,” said
George, with interest.</p>

<p>“Ma foi, but what ees this?” muttered
Pierre, scratching his head. “I no understand
it—ze talk ees so fast.”</p>

<p>Colonel Ellison merely nodded, to show
that the arrangement suited him.</p>

<p>“Well,” proceeded President Mosley, hesitatingly,
“I suppose we shall have to briefly
review the whole matter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” said Redfern, eagerly.</p>

<p>“It seems, then, that one day last spring,
your employer, Colonel Ellison, sent you to a
bank to collect a certain sum of money. Unfortunately,
you placed this in your overcoat
pocket?”</p>

<p>Redfern nodded.</p>

<p>“And when you went to a restaurant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
absent-mindedly hung the garment on a
rack?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!”</p>

<p>“And on leaving rather hastily, took what
you thought to be your own overcoat, and
were on the train to Nyack before discovering
that this was not the case?”</p>

<p>“Correct again,” said Redfern, his tone indicating
suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>“On returning to the restaurant, you found
your overcoat gone?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>During this conversation a very strange expression
came over Colonel Ellison’s face. He
looked decidedly uncomfortable; and his
glance shifted uneasily from the president to
Redfern and back again.</p>

<p>It was plain that the similarity between the
overcoats had been the means of losing the
Colonel’s money.</p>

<p>After a short pause, Mr. Mosley continued:</p>

<p>“You made every effort to find the money
which had been in your keeping, and failed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes—but tell me—has it been recovered?”
asked Redfern, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m glad I can say that it has.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>

<p>Norman Redfern gave an exclamation of
relief; his eyes sparkled with pleasure, while
Colonel Ellison stopped abruptly in his walk,
and stared down at him.</p>

<p>“Bully for you, Redfern!” cried Jack
Lyons, enthusiastically. And George Clayton
slapped his former tutor on the shoulder,
and shook his hand warmly.</p>

<p>Pierre Dufour looked on in amazement, and
murmured, “Ma foi, what ees this?”</p>

<p>For an instant, Colonel Ellison remained
silent. Then, clearing his throat, he held out
his hand.</p>

<p>“Redfern,” he said, frankly, “a man should
always be willing to acknowledge his mistakes.
I ask your pardon for having wrongly
suspected you.”</p>

<p>“And I freely give it,” exclaimed the happy
Redfern. “I will admit that appearances
were against me. But, Mosley, how in the
world did all this come about?”</p>

<p>“Well, to continue our story: I was, at the
time, a professor at Ripley and expected you,
also, to join the staff. Unfortunately, President
Blackwell considered you—shall I say it?—guilty.
And that ended your chances.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Redfern, “I have been only too
well aware of that.”</p>

<p>“But I had confidence in you; and was
determined to prove that it was well placed.
I advertised freely, and——”</p>

<p>“You did?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir! And in my spare time investigated
to the best of my ability. Nothing resulted,
and I got a bit discouraged. But I
don’t believe in giving up easily. Several
times, at intervals, I went back to the restaurant,
made inquiries and kept the matter fresh
in their minds. Then what should happen?
A few days ago, I got a letter; and it made
me jump.”</p>

<p>“How can I ever thank you enough?”
murmured Redfern.</p>

<p>“The man was a traveling salesman—only
occasionally visited New York—and did not
again have a chance to go to the restaurant
until quite recently. But he was honest, and
wished to find the owner of the money. The
proprietor told him to communicate with me.”</p>

<p>Redfern seized the other’s hand.</p>

<p>“Mosley,” he said, “I’ll never forget you
for this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span></p>

<p>The president smiled.</p>

<p>“Well, my story is almost finished. I was
about to write to Colonel Ellison, in order
that he might meet the gentleman and have
his money restored. The visit is most opportune,
though I regret his errand.”</p>

<p>“Think no more about it,” said Uncle Dan,
hastily. “I was once a boy myself; circumstances
had a great deal to do with my feelings.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Dan,” put in George Clayton, “may
I speak a word to you?”</p>

<p>“Well, young man, what is it?”</p>

<p>Briefly, George explained the whole story
of his connection with the house-boat expedition,
and this time his guardian, in the light
of recent developments, listened and believed.</p>

<p>“You must understand, George,” he said,
“though Redfern is not to blame in the matter,
you have acted in a most reckless and
self-willed fashion. We shall talk about it
later.”</p>

<p>“I no comprehend, monsieur the Colonel,”
exclaimed Pierre. “Ees nobody any scamps,
eh? Ma foi!”</p>

<p>“Shake Mr. Redfern by the hand, Pierre,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
commanded the Colonel. “It was all a misunderstanding.”</p>

<p>“If it hadn’t been for Pierre’s meddling, a
great deal of trouble might have been saved,”
said George, half-resentfully. “He butted in,
and——”</p>

<p>“George—George!” cried Uncle Dan, “I
must protest against the use of such slang—such
a lack of courtesy. Affairs have turned
out happily for all concerned; and this is no
time for ill-feeling.”</p>

<p>“I guess you are right, uncle,” admitted
George, frankly; and then turning toward the
chauffeur, he added, “Everything is all right.”</p>

<p>“All one grand mistake? Ma foi!” said
the Frenchman, with the corners of his mouth
beginning to curve upward. Then, with a sly
glance at Colonel Ellison, whose stern countenance
still showed a trace of discomfiture, he
extended his hand toward the former tutor.
“We shake hand, Monsieur Redfern,” he exclaimed.
“I’m sorry I say I would your face
smack.”</p>

<p>“It’s all forgotten, Pierre,” laughed Redfern,
cordially.</p>

<p>The Frenchman smiled broadly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span></p>

<p>“A la bonne heure, Monsieur George!” he
cried. “We are friends again. But nevaire
you say ‘fired’—‘fired’ to me.” And this
time, Pierre Dufour showed that his resentfulness
was a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Norman Redfern presently slapped Jack
Lyons on the back.</p>

<p>“Jack,” he said, “your house-boat trip has
certainly resulted in making a great change
in the feelings of one young man.”</p>

<p>“And it will have a more substantial result
than that,” put in Uncle Dan, quickly. “I
hope you will become George’s tutor again.”</p>

<p>Redfern’s features lighted up.</p>

<p>“Certainly—I shall be only too glad,” he
began.</p>

<p>But President Mosley hastily interposed.</p>

<p>“One minute, Redfern,” he exclaimed.
“Colonel Ellison’s offer is very kind; but it
might interfere with your professorship at
Ripley Academy.”</p>

<p>And when the true significance of his words
was realized, a tremendous volley of cheers
rose on the air.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE END OF THE CRUISE</p>


<p>President Mosley, accompanied by Uncle
Dan, Redfern and Pierre Dufour, entered the
Academy building, while the boys wandered
off to the athletic field. The events, rapid
and unexpected, and the happy termination
of the house-boat trip, had put everybody in
the best of humor.</p>

<p>The Ripley flag still floated proudly from
the top of the pole. Bill Stiles and his followers,
hot, victorious, husky-voiced and tired,
marched around the field. They had won
the second event, and Ripley was crowned
with glory.</p>

<p>Owen Andrews picked up his tin horn. It
was now a battered and twisted wreck.</p>

<p>Andrews looked at it sadly, put it to his
lips, and, with a tremendous effort, managed
to draw forth a thin, dismal groan.</p>

<p>“Too bad it didn’t last for just one more
blow,” put in George Clayton.</p>

<p>“Why, Bill number one?” demanded Stiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span></p>

<p>“Because I intend to enter Ripley,” answered
George, calmly.</p>

<p>The hoots, yells and jeers which this remark
brought forth from the Thorntons filled the
hearts of the Ripleys with pure, unalloyed joy.</p>

<p>“I say, Joe Preston,” remarked Fred Winter,
abruptly, “I knew it.”</p>

<p>“Knew what?”</p>

<p>“That you wouldn’t do a stroke of work
on the history of our trip.”</p>

<p>“But I have; I wrote the heading. When
I get home, I’ll finish it sure,” laughed Joe.
“Anyway, I have an idea.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“We’ll try to get the governor to put a bill
through the legislature for the state to buy
the ‘Gray Gull’ and place it in a museum.”</p>

<p>“You silly thing! Do be serious.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see: there was the ‘Half-moon,’ the
‘Clermont,’ and now the ‘Gray Gull.’ I’m
going to put that in my history, too.”</p>

<p>“One thing we came near forgetting, fellows,”
put in Jack Lyons. He seized Aleck
Hunt by the shoulder. “How about that
story of yours?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” chorused the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span></p>

<p>“What story?”</p>

<p>“What story? Why, about Joe Archer
and Battery Park, of course.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Do you fellows really think
I’m going to tell it now?”</p>

<p>“You bet we do.”</p>

<p>“Well, I put it in pickle some time ago;
and the jar’s been left on the house-boat. It
won’t be taken out before I get a bite to eat—no
siree.” And Aleck backed away.</p>

<p>Joe Preston winked at the others; his grin
grew to positively enormous dimensions.
Then he burst into a loud, long laugh.</p>

<p>“I wonder what we’re going to do next, Bob?”</p>

<p>It was Tom that asked the question.</p>

<p>“Well, Ramblers,” spoke up Jack Lyons,
heartily, “we’ve had such a jolly good time
on this trip I should say we’d all better take
another.”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” shouted his hearers. “That’s
what we’ll do.”</p>
